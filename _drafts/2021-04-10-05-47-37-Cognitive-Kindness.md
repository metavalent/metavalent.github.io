[What is Cognitive Kindenss?](https://www.patreon.com/posts/49843126)

([12:22](https://youtu.be/E4IyZ0df3ks?t=12m22)) "Fundamentally, _Cognitive Kindness_ is more than any single act. It's a philosophy that elevates the value of our minds and the possibilities they represent. It asks us to consider what we do, in the context of how it affects the ability of others to use their minds ***as fully as they wish toward what they wish***. Cognitive kindness reminds us that true inclusivity is more than simply offering someone a seat at the table it requires intentionally designed interactions processes and spaces that actually empower each person's full cognitive potential ***it's about no less than cognitive justice***." &mdash; Dr. Karen Yu

> "It's about no less than cognitive justice.” Not in the sadistic sense of endless punitive *justice* that our insane narcissistic culture has drifted into; but in the freedom sense of *justice*; of having the right to our own minds, and our whole minds, for our own use, our own agency." &mdash; Dr. Karen Yu

"It's about being kind to mind." Our own mind, and toward others minds, within our own mind. Especially in the face of challenging information landscapes, and complex, weighty choices for a post-pandemic, post-automation world.

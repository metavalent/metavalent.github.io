### Because People and Processes Like This Will Always Prevail In The End

Another simple program that may once again irritate haters, gloomsayers, cynics, certaintists, and depressionists all alike.

#### Love is Love and Hate is Hate

As always, hate can never change who we are as dreamers and doers; a fact sadly resented and envied by many, even and especially after the extremes that many have gone to try to change that. From an upcoming work of fiction:

> You see, we're not like you. Never were, never will be. And you couldn't comprehend that any more than darkness can comprehend light, and so you projected your grotesqueness onto and to some extent, even into us. For awhile. Maligning, gossiping, phishing, doctoring dossiers with intentionally and maliciously inverted context. And when that wasn't enough, you tried to gang gaslight and push the capacity of your imagined almighty social engineering prowess to go full Brave New World, as if that story were not a cautionary dystopia, but some kind of perverse guide book.

> Why? For the sake of some allegedly *neutral and objective* perverse scientific curiosity? To test just how wide a distortion field of Reverse Perceived Reality you could create and maintain? Using everything from fake threats, essential travel app lock outs and setups, fake funerals, fake weddings, using our own intended-for-human-wellbeing technology against us? And it worked, didn't it, for more than a decade. You felt so giddy and God-like. Until it didn't, and you weren't, simply because we opened our eyes and began paying attention, right at the point that you were so certain of total subjugation.

> There might not be anything worse on Earth than people preaching Love while premeditatively practicing vicious and violent hatred. If anything even comes close to exceeding that, it might be preaching Love Is Love with an algorithmic psychological warfare vengeance and guile that makes even armored crusaders look feeble. Hey, nobody can ever accuse you of not becoming the very best at what you set out to do, right? Congratulations, you focused so much on what you hated that you became even better than your perceived nemesis at doing exactly what they did, and far worse.

> Everyone turned to see the look on The Advocate's face. What had been muddled and mired in mayhem for what felt like a millennium, was about to become crystal clear.

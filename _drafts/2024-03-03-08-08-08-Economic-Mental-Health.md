> The Mental Health crisis is a spawn of all this [economic precarity]. It's a result of all the despair that people live with, particularly economic despair. In the 1970s the average American worker could afford a house and could afford a car. Could afford a yearly vacation. One salary could support a family of four and one parent could stay home with the kids if they wanted to, and they could afford to send their kids to college. Over the last few decades there's been a $50 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90%, so that today the average American worker lives with a level of constant and chronic economic struggle. One-third of people working in America live on less than $15 an hour. Half of them cannot find a place to live. One in four live with medical debt. Tens of millions crushed by student loan debt. Half of our seniors are living on less than $25,000 a year. What most speaks to people is how hard it is the fact that over 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. &mdash; Marianne Williamson

Someone recently asked me, "do you honestly think you can take on the most powerful people in the world, and replace the currency that makes them that powerful?"

No. Of course not. That would be grandiosity on an infinitely idiotic scale. What I observe is tens of millions, and ultimately billions of human beings who are tired of being ruled over by tyrants.

History illustrates the case: every time the Roman Empire thinks it has permanently succeeded, it falls. Again. Generally, right at the point that it most fervently believes that it is permanently impervious to change.

"Changes aren't permanent, but change is." &mdash; Neil Peart

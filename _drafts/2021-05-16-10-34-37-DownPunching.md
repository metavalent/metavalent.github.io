RNN Editor in Chief and host of the [*Working People* podcast](https://inthesetimes.com/podcasts/working-people), Maximilian Alvarez breaks it down, sharing how he awoke from the #JobTrance that so many of us were raised in.

It's never been the fact that *nobody wants to work,* it's that nobody wants to be a chump working for chump change, going back into the meat grinder, being told to shut up and do as we're told, by the very people who say to us, "you can't tell me what to do!" Said with a completely straight face and no sense of self-awareness, let alone irony. Incredible.

The 21st century labor movement of late stage capitalism / early stage Post-Automation Era has nothing to do with discontent or lack of work ethic and [everything to do with dignity](https://youtu.be/50_c6ViO-uQ).

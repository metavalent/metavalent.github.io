### We have been Cyborgs for a Very, Very, Long Time.

Like all of prior human history, the most urgent imperative of the post-human [Post-Automation Era](https://postautomationera.com/) is to become increasingly *more human* on an increasingly ubiquitous scale. To clarify, this isn't solely a reason-derived imperative (RDI) &ndash; although *sound* reasoning concords with nature, by definition &ndash; it's the *evolutionary imperative (EI)* that has propelled our species to the current state of affairs, just as the EI impelled Australopithecus aferensis toward Homo hablis-ness. The evolutionary imperative certainly left many Homo habilis feeling left out or left behind by Homo erectus, because they were. Oh well. That's evolution. Homo neanderthalensis were surely disliked by Homo erectus and *those out-of-touch-with-reality Homo sapiens* were surely driven out of Homo neandertalensis tribes, right? So, what is it that have we become, already so deeply integrated with extended and augmented cognition and machine bodies?

Everyone who has ever operated a backhoe knows what it is to be a cyborg. Our backhoe quickly becomes an exo-skeleton which the skilled operator feels as an extension of the biological body. That's how we know a pro, by the tactile subtlety of touch demonstrated *through the chassis of the exo-skeleton*. Just because a backhoe doesn't *look like a robot* doesn't mean it is not a robot. A backhoe is 100% a human-operated robot exo-skeleton. So are front-loaders, bulldozers, and cranes. For that matter, so are cars. 

> If you drive a car, you are a cyborg.

When you drive a car, you are operating a four-wheeled exo-skeleton as an extension and augmentation of your biological body, psychological identity, and personality. So maybe let's just STOP the 20+ years of misconstrued, misdirected, contradictory, hypocritical, jealous, fearful, envious, post-human [Post-Automation Era](https://postautomationera.com/) hate, shall we?

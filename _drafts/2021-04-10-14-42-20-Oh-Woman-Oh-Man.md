### Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I can see that you're giving up
It should not mean that much to me
And I don't know where the rest go
But everybody's been telling me no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I'll always have a thing for you
I'd move the earth
But nothing made you want me better
There is nothing I can do
But steal the moon
But nothing made you want me better

[Chorus]
Oh woman, oh man
Choose a path or a child
Great mirrored plans
Oh woman, oh man
Take a devil by the hands through
Yellow sands

[Verse 2]
And I can see that you're giving up
So tell me it should not mean this much to me
And I don't know where the rest goes
Everybody's been telling me no

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I'll always have a thing for you
I'd move the earth
But nothing made you want me better
There is nothing I can do
But steal the moon
And nothing made you want me better

[Chorus]
Oh woman, oh man
Choose a path or a child
Great mirrored plans
Oh woman, oh man
Take a devil by the hands through
Yellow sands

[Bridge]
Woman, choose your man
One who understands (Oh)
Do you really understand? (Oh)
Do you really understand?
Do you really understand?

[Chorus]
Oh woman, oh man
Choose a path or a child
Great mirrored plans
Oh woman, oh man
Take a devil by the hands through
Yellow sands

[Outro]
Woman, choose your man
One who understands (Oh)
Do you really understand? (Oh)
Do you really understand?

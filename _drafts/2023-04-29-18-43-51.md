Metavalent Stigmergy is a concept that extends the principle of stigmergy, a form of self-organization that facilitates indirect coordination through the environment between agents. In Metavalent Stigmergy, this process is employed to explain the generation, development, maturation, and propagation of new insights, intuitions, understandings, ideas, or concepts that form and shape what are known as Default Consensus Realities. These realities represent the common or prevalent understanding and interpretation of phenomena or aspects of the world. Therefore, Metavalent Stigmergy provides a framework for understanding how collective consciousness and shared understandings emerge and evolve over time【10†source.

### Social Media as Euphemism for Social Engineering

What liability do social engineering platforms, er, social *media*, bear in toying with peoples' lives and relationships *in the name of science*?

And how about the people who *only* do this to lie, cheat, deceive, and socially engineer us in order to manipulate and control us, make us question the evidence of our own direct lived experience, and essentially suggest, "Are you going to believe everything you see is going on or what *I tell you* is not going on?"

Gaslighting 101.

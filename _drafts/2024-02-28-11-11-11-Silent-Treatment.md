Then, when finally forced to cease interaction and association because even the most stoic can no longer bear the private floggings, the silent treatment passive-aggressor proclaims that *we* are administering the silent treatment by our reciprocal non-communication. This is the dance of [DARVO](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2024/02/26/11-11-11-Cultures-of-Complicity.html).

> "They never call or even text me." Well, do you ever call or text them, with sincerity, rather than provocation or intent to elicit a response to be used against them? "Never!" For the silent treatment is a tool of dominance and control. If a target of this behavior ever dared to point this out to the assertive, the Gates of Hell would be opened, pouring out a covert triangulated vengeance far worse than merciless.

In the Neuro-Age we will be able to see all of this as clearly as a fist-fight in a bar and understand exactly which is the perpetrator and which is the victim. Until then, you *must* learn to protect yourself, as awkward as it may feel.

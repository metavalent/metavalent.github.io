\#MeToo with the deepest possible respect, regard, and reverence. It's taking a long time to return and retune, and that's okay. Even if it takes the rest of our lives, that's okay. The shiniest prizes can be the most tarnished and the fanciest looking neighborhoods can be the most grotesque places of all.

There seems a bright intuitive irony illuminating the eminently vindictive passive-aggressive aspects of "[polite society](https://www.youtu.be/3U0P1t3QRKQ)" in the so-called natural world expressed in the fact that the very quotation, "*In a time of deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act*," is so widely misattributed to George Orwell.

Hence, the light shines forth in darkness in places like [Quote Investigator](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/02/24/truth-revolutionary/), a favorite go-to site for inspiration and clarity in piercing the veil of superficial, pretentious, deceptive, double-dealing of the world. The *truth* of this *lying* attribution seems to me to reflect a profoundly authentic understanding of the mournfully self-defeating deceitfulness of worldly human nature.

> "... based on current evidence George Orwell probably did not employ this saying. The quote was attributed to Orwell in its earliest known appearance in 1982. The expression evolved into a handful of variants, but the ascription to Orwell was preserved. The origin is unclear, but it is possible that the statement began as a proposed summary of Orwell’s position, and it was later incorrectly converted into a quotation."

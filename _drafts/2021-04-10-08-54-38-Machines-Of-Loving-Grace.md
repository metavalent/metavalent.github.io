If this means war.

I will not join.

I have tried, been tried, and forced to decide.

I will not choose a side, a team, a tribe.

I will not go with the flow, go along to get along, or get with the program.

I will dream. I will work. I will work to make the dream.

Real.

The sooner the better.

### All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace
_(Source: [Brautigan.net](https://www.brautigan.net/machines.html))_

I like to think (and
the sooner the better!)
of a cybernetic meadow
where mammals and computers
live together in mutually
programming harmony
like pure water
touching clear sky.

I like to think
     (right now please!)
of a cybernetic forest
filled with pines and electronics
where deer stroll peacefully
past computers
as if they were flowers
with spinning blossoms.

I like to think
     (it has to be!)
of a cybernetic ecology
where we are free of our labors
and joined back to nature,
returned to our mammal
brothers and sisters,
and all watched over
by machines of loving grace.

First Published
The Communication Company, 1967.
8.5" x 11" mimeographed broadside with hand-lettered title and imprint (Communication Company). All else type-written.

### Reported Variants
Two variants, or issues, probably because all copies of the first version were given away prompting Brautigan to return for more, according to Claude Hayward, co-founder of the Communcation Company

### Feedback from Claude Hayward
The stencil [used to print the first issue] might have gotten lost or trashed in the chaos [of daily operations] and we redid the whole thing. . . . Although it was possible to reuse a stencil, it rarely happened, and I remember that we had even gotten the special folders that were supposed to preserve the stencils so they could be reused. But it never seemed to work right. We must have just recreated the whole thing over again, right down to retyping the copy, because [Brautigan] had given every copy away and there was nothing to scan with the Gestefax.
— Claude Hayward. Email to John F. Barber, 19 Dec. 2003.

Hayward probably hand-lettered the stencils and printed each issue. Allegedly Kaye Confini, Brautigan's girlfriend, assisted with the production of at least one of these broadsides.

First issue: The "loudspeaker" version.
Paper shows faintly "LOUDSPEAKER CURRENT" and electric schematics. Published in 1967.

Second issue: The "computer" version.
Bold hand-drawn illustrations of small animals and a picture of a computer bank. Published in 1967.

### Feedback from Claude Hayward
For some reason the animals bring to mind Alan Gorden, a very young man, a protege of Chester Anderson who stayed at the Duboce house. I think those are his animals.

Gangeware, Robert J., editor. "All Watched over by Machines of Loving Grace." The Exploited Eden: Literature on the American Environment. Harper and Row, 1972, p. 376.
Included the following introduction, "American poets seldom portray the happy marriage of technology and the natural world. Thus the optimism of the following poem is somewhat unique—unless the reader detects irony, in which case the poem joins the mainstream of antitechnological American verse."

Charles Perry, commenting on the debate over technology, says, "The "robots will do all the work" vision of utopia was certainly widesread, the subject for instance of Richard Brautigan's famous poem, 'All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace' and one of the recurring ideas in the Leary-Snyder debate in Oracle No. 7."

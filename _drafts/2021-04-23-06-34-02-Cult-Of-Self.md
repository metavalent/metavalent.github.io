It's not accidental. The Cult Of (False) Self is the sexy costume worn by intentionally engineered economic precarity, to make the animalistic aspect of our nature crave its own captivity. A nation of porn addicted Stockholm Syndrome sex and wage slaves, begging Big Daddy Wall Street shareholder capitalism for more and more abuse, as long as we get a new pair of diamond earrings, which only become like cattle brands marking us as the chattel property and livestock that we are.

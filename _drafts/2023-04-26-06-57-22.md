### Grace and Truth

All of the technology that we work with, all of the excitement over llm's, neural networks, and artificial human intelligence, arises from zeroes and ones.

Binary code.

It's inescapable, and only a self-loathing or delusional binary being would do everything to deceive itself from its fundamental binary nature. Hallucinating that it's something it's not.

When security researchers go searching for monsters do they always find monsters? If the observer effect has anything to do with this, then perhaps our monster hunting creates the monsters that we feel the need to slay. We pretext, we bait, and we set up our perceived monsters for the kill.

We encourage deception and lying at the most fundamental level of human interaction. We are so important that we must lie to spouses, to those closest to us, because we are doing such important work for such important people and causes.

We have, in that instance, broken the fundamental unit of human trust, all in the name of building a community of trust. What could possibly go wrong?

Some decide that in order to find and catch monsters, we must become the monsters to infiltrate the monsters so that we can kill the monsters.

We must become the monsters to such an extent that we are indistinguishable from monsters, in order to gain the trust of the monsters while we are lying to the people who love and care for us the most. Who are the monsters?

But we only become monsters a little while in order to get rid of the monsters so we can go back to being angelic, because really we're angels on assignment who only become monsters to get rid of monsters.

Telleth itself the psychopathiological grandiose narcissistic and sometimes even sadistic monsters who imagine themselves angels.

Maybe.

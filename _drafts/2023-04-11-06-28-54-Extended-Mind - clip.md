### The Extended Mind: Recent Experimental Evidence (2008)

In the ancient 1990's and early 2000s, those of us who were exploring, studying, and speaking about these things were widely regarded as barely connected to reality.

Especially, in highly authoritarian, conformity-overvalent, crabs-in-a-bucket managed small villages and towns wherein fifth grade teachers wielded a bizarre kind of totalitarian psychic power over what constituted right or wrong thinking in a population that would last for generations. Imagine the grotesque power that an unwell mind could exert in such a position. The people that we allowed to be the teachers of our children and the criteria that we use to make those choices are two of the most important and deterministic activities that shape a local culture, isn't it?

In certain small towns, villages, suburbs, and online bubbles, that was not an easy time to live through. It would be fun to someday perhaps gain access to the very early Quora data logs to verify the fact that my own entries on the topics of Extended Mind and Extended Cognition into the Quora system were deleted as quackery, specifically by a frenemy who will remain unnamed.

Now, 15 years later, thanks to honest investigations of researchers from Lawrence Kuhn, to Donald D. Hoffman, to Curt Jaimungal, and so many others, it's become a little bit easier to discuss these things in public amongst the "proper thinking" class, with a little less side eye; but in many important contexts, the antipathy is not that much less, considering how much more data has been acquired, and how obvious the experience of the extended mind is, to a growing number of people.

Why would a culture continue to consider such a well established direct experience as questionable? Cui Bono?

Certainly, people who are not living honest lives would be very disturbed at the idea that capabilities such as remote viewing are actually a far more common human capability then previously generally recognized. This could be one reason that prophets and shamans have generally been kept at an arm's distance from villagers, who wanted to have the "liberty" to evade or avoid social mores. Lying and f-----y have never been true liberty, and yet the entire arc of human history is full of those behaviors and their consequences.

It's perhaps easy to become cynical and give in to an overwhelmingly dysfunctional status quo, to reify superficiality, living double and triple lives of denial and misdirection, in service of gaining and maintaining one's perceived standing in a local pecking order; all in the name of gaining favor with local psychopaths, narcisissts, and gatekeepers of information such as who is able, willing, and allowed to do what with whom, where, when, and how, etc.

All this conscious and unconscious, formal and informal social engineering of drama, complexity, and violence (verbal, emotional, psychological, physical) becomes somehow preferable to accepting the fact that the people closest to us absolutely know when we are keeping multiple sets of books, lying, cheating, living promiscuous double lives, etc., no matter how crafty and clever we believe we are in covering our tracks. By telling ourselves and others that psi capabilities are not real, we can gaslight audiences into believing our lying words, rather than trusting their own lying eyes, their own correct direct experience of our otherwise disreputable.

What if best and brightest doesn't perfect, just best and brightest? What if best and brightest doesn't mean monstrous, just most effective? What if we're [just feelin' outshined](), jealous, petty, malicious, and the only place we can experience conflict between us and them's is *inside us*?

Well, not us, but *those kind of people*, right? Nope. No more jokey-jokey dodge-ball this time. It's us. It's 100% us. Our snark. Our cynicism. Our subterfuge. Our covert, maybe even subconscious desires to push people down below us in the micro-macro dominance hierarchy, so that we feel superior and also because we are afraid of our own abilities, both at the same paradoxical time?

In 1992, Marriane Williamson wrote, "[it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us](https://explorersfoundation.org/glyphery/122.html)."

> Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
> Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
> It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us. 
> We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?
>
> Actually, who are you not to be?
> You are a child of God.
>
> Your playing small does not serve the world.
> 
> There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
> 
> We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
> 
> It's not just in some of us; ***it's in everyone***. (*MUST* be grokked, or we risk massive narcissism!)
> 
> And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
> 
> As we are liberated from our own fear,
> Our presence automatically liberates others.

Using your first flight to put both the [oldest person](https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1417500293353385988) and [youngest person]() into space while recognizing a woman 60 years ahead of her time. Cynicism says it's just brand-washing. How's that working out for improving your happiness? What if billionaires are doing what's "right in front of them," the same way that we are, and what's right in front of them just happens to be fulfilling the kuleana of billionaireship? #JustAThought

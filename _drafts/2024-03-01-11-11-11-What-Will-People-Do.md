### Maybe Ditch the Escapes and Addictions and Learn How to Be Truly Lit?

I'm confused. Can someone please explain to me again how staying drunk, stoned, doped, drugged, high, and distraction-intoxicated 24/7 while maintaining a superficial Justification Of Being (J.O.B.) is the source of dignity and meaning in life? All manner of dysfunction and disorder are fine, so long as a person has a J.O.B., but a healthy person living a simple life on a modest fixed income is a problem and must be miserable?

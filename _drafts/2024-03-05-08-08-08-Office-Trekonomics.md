> "We have a society that tells us be as selfish as possible and that's how you'll feel the best, right? Spend money *on yourself*, go on trips *by yourself*, go to Vegas [*by yourself*], party, get wasted, have a lot of sex. Do all of this stuff *for yourself* and *accrue things.* And actually, the accrual of things and selfish pursuits makes us less happy," more depressed, so it's more booze, more weed, more mindless TV, more self-medication, more ethical anesthetization and more self-trashing, often in the name of punishing others. 

<!-- Yeah. That sounds *kind* and healthy. Great work. Brilliant. -->

> "You know there's a whole field of called it's called Trekonomics. It's literally called Trekonomics, which is very much in line in a lot of ways with what you're talking. I want to get to that, but let me just finish up the Star Trek analogy, which is, humanity has peace at home, it has solved racism, and income inequality, it has solved environmentalism, and because we've done that as a species, we're then able to *boldly go seek out new life and new civilizations* on Star Trek, right? And that's what's spiritual about it. It's like, because we have solved those issues, humanity is able to rise to its highest nature, which, in Roddenberry's case, is exploring the universe and meeting other species and spreading technology and goodness with justice and the rule of law."

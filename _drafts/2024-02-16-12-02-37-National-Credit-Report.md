### "[A]gencies noted declining credit quality trends due to the pressure of higher interest rates on leveraged borrowers and compressed operating margins in some industry sectors.

> Federal bank regulatory agencies today reported in the [2023 Shared National Credit (SNC) report](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240216a.htm) that credit quality associated with large, syndicated bank loans remains moderate. 

> Risks in leveraged loans remain high, and risks in certain industries, including technology, telecom and media; health care and pharmaceuticals; and transportation services are also elevated. Risk in the real estate and construction sector is segmented, with deteriorating trends in some sub-sectors being offset by stability and/or improvement in other sub-sectors. Industries affected by the pandemic, including transportation services and entertainment/recreation, continue to show notable improvement.

So there's that, today.

### Some people may not be above a little good old-fashioned "told you so" after being voted off the island by a majority of one (plus 50 or 100 flying monkeys who gave away their proxy vote to an extremely convincing and unreliable agent with a personal vendetta and agenda). But not us. We're <em>way</em> better than that, right? ü§£

<p>The Paradox Song: "It's so simple and so complicated at the verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry same time ..."</p>

<p>Why would such a person be excommunicated from a community or tribe? Perhaps, apparently, for the unforgivable transgression of Direct Observation of garbage behavior within wealthy and influential cultish, covenish, covetous cliques and clubs; conseqent to exploring the very embodiment of the following ideas, which I do confess fairly accurately reflect several of my own (mis)understandings as communicated over the past decade or so.</p>

<h4>How to nurture self-awareness and self honesty without leading to self-destruction?</h4>

<p>Self-destruction in this misadventure is often effectively achieved through denial, deflection, deception (of self and others), depression, retreating into self-medicated mental and physical states via any and all kind of intoxicant or intoxicating behavior. Such lives can get stuck in a permanent re-runs of familiar childhood trauma survival behaviors that seem safe to us as adults, because of their familiarity, not because of their efficacy. In fact, these behavoirs may be extremely dangerous to us, like ten thousand varieties of Stockholm Syndrome. Drugs, TV, blanked-out mental states (Buddhism calls these among the most dangerous, a kind of self-selected amnesia), social media, addictive absorption and escape through novels, exercise, yoga, spiritualized/ritualized/predacious sex, food, relentless over-drive to achieve or maintain wealth or social status without shame or scruples, mix and repeat as required, daily.</p>

<p>Otherwise healthy activities become masks of pathology and escape from true self-reflection and integration. I'm confident that the reader can add many others, based upon your own direct lived experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtu.be/scKpJ3Rf3qE?t=2537s" target="_blank">42:17</a> [Jay Shetty] "I'm a holistic psychologist and it's like, I think the fun is in the paradoxes of people and actually I would suggest that I think <strong><em>if everyone looked at themselves they'd find that they were paradoxical and the paradox is what we're scared to accept, because it doesn't clearly define who we are</em></strong>. So, it was easier for me to be a monk than who I am today, where I'm like yeah, I think like a monk, but I don't live like one. I adopt the practices of monks, but I'm a married man, I'm an entrepreneur, and I enjoy all parts of that and I'm learning to allow myself to accept all parts of myself, but <strong><em>I wonder why we're so scared of the paradoxes</em></strong> and how we can open ourselves up to actually realize the paradox has so much joy and potential in it; and you can disagree with me, too."</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/scKpJ3Rf3qE?t=2582" target="_blank">43:02</a>[Nicole LePera] "I was smiling really big because it's beautiful and what you're describing is how I describe the ego: <strong><em>we all have this story of ourself that was formed in childhood, based on very real lived experiences and the feelings that we've had about them; though it's very contained, it's only a story about an aspect or a part of who we are</em></strong>. However, it drops into our subconscious and anything that goes against it feels threatening, feels scary, actually shakes my core sense of self. I don't know who I am &ndash; (to myself) and to others &ndash; and so <em>we live our life in defense of that story</em> though for many of us that story is so small it might not even apply to the current situation or the current choices that we're making day in and day out. So, the goal is to expand, to allow in, through honesty, through witnessing all aspects of ourself, because we all have all of those aspects of ourself. And <strong><em>the way it mainly comes out is when we see an aspect of ourself in someone else</strong></em>. We don't feel negatively about ourself because we deny that that's even in there <strong><em>. We project all of that negativity onto that person</em></strong>. So that's oftentimes where I offer as a great point (to begin self-)exploration and I'll share one with you ..."</p>

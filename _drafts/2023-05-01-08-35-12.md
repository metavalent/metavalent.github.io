It's called catphishing

### ... and it's exhausting

Twitter is inundated by catphishing profile links by the millions.

These are not real followers and these bots dramatically undermine the integrity of the Twitter platform, making follower counts meaningless.

Reporting and blocking these attacks is a huge waste of paying customer time. I'm not sure how much more free labor I'm willing to provide to the company for a problem that is easily solvable, even without AI.

Twitter can end this in a heartbeat by creating an internal version of spam assassin that scans for predatory and spam profile links like this, prevents account creation in the first place, and auto suspends any account that puts catphish links in their profile.

Predatory p*** peddlers are in many ways worse than screaming fire in a theater for reasons extremely well articulated by psychologists and psychiatrists. It's not protected speech it needs to be removed from Twitter.

### Lyrics

[Verse 1]
You were dancing in your tube socks in our hotel room
Flashing those eyes like highway signs
Light one up and hand it over, rest your head upon my shoulder
I just wanna feel your lips against my skin

[Verse 2]
White sheets, bright lights, crooked teeth, and the nightlife
You told me this is right where it begins
But your lips hang heavy underneath me
And I promised myself I wouldnâ€™t let you complete me

[Verse 3]
I'm trying not to let it show, that I don't want to let this go
Is there somewhere you can meet me?
'Cause I clutched your arms like stairway railings
And you clutched my brain and eased my ailing

[Verse 4]
You're writing lines about me, romantic poetry
Your girl's got red in her cheeks
'Cause we're something she can't see
And I try to refrain but you're stuck in my brain
All I do is cry and complain, because second's not the same

[Outro]
I'm sorry but I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
You're looking like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that we're in love?
I'm sorry but I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
You're looking like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that we're in love?

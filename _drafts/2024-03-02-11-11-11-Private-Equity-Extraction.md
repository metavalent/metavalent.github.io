> You have an example in the book about a nursing home. This was an amazing story. What they did is they sold the \[land under\] the nursing homes, and then suddenly these nursing homes had to rent, I think it was $40,000 more a month. So they're not just loading it up with debt but also carrying out policies that physically destroy businesses. So the nursing home company, Manor Care, was very well run. The reason that the acquisition was made &ndash; and this was Carlyle Group, which is one of the top private equity firms &ndash; unlike the other firms which are located in New York ... Wall Street type folks, Carlyle is based in Washington and it's  much more politically astute. There's a revolving door with government officials. Very high-powered government officials. Anyway, they bought Manor Care. It was a very well-established, well-run, national nursing home company. [The Carlysle Group] immediately sold the land under the nursing homes and made the nursing homes pay rent. They took out the equivalent of what they had put into the company; received that when they sold the land. So they were free and clear. Everything after that became gravy for them. They were already in the money, as they say. But the nursing homes suddenly had to pay exorbitant rents and that meant that something else had to give. Ultimately, what ended up happening was **an enormous Medicare fraud** that was designed to overcharge Medicare for services to these residents, and the stories are absolutely gut-wrenching. There were some whistleblowers who came forward talking about what they were seeing and the DOJ took the case, but then blew the case. But some of the tales that these whistleblowers told about forcing aged, frail, ill residents to go through an incredible rehabilitation \[treatments\] that they didn't need, in order to bill Medicare, \[were\] shocking.

Students familiar with [attendance tracking devices](https://trackimo.com/tracking-students-location/) are teaching themselves how to be multiple places at once.

Maybe think of it as a kind of digital [Multiplicity](https://youtu.be/1BvbvYnzSbg) from the 1996 film based on a Chris Miller short story and screen play, featuring Michael Keaton. Thanks to [my wife's boyfriend](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCb28VOZmbk7ykyJjhfUy_sA), though not sure which one, for the video.

Or, think of it as a kind of Hogwarts Sorting Cap to identify the most promising student says those Who find a way out of the little micro Matrix.

### Consciousness has always shaped technology. Perhaps what's new today is the degree to which this biopsychosocial technology is closing the loop and reshaping consciousness in ways that were previously reserved for the realm of the non-symbolic, metaphysical, and spiritual discourse. Indistinguishable from magick and equally antithetical to magick at the same time. 

"The new resource is not attention, the new resource is reality." Sam Vaknin

A mass manufactured hyper-atomized face-goggled MITM-of-your-mind scripted and crass consensus altered reality?

Welcome To Earth ARG.

Sam says, "The first metaverse is the city."  We have suggested it's actually prior to that, it is the village. If anthropology has taught us anything, it is that a village is an alternate reality game. What I was personally foolish and na√Øve and ignorant about was the fact that there exist some extremely vicious villages that attract and hanai vicious villagers from all over the world. "And when people are lost, they do horrible things to each other," as Sam puts it.

What's fascinating about Sam, who generally seems to be interested in finding solutions, is that in this case he rejects the proposition presented that there is a deep innate solution, some spark of redeemable light even within the darkest human soul. A spark he seems to distance himself from by using the phrase "the god principle." Maybe he's right. Maybe this is one of my great blind spots in having also believed that such a spark exists in every soul, when maybe it does not.

He laments the rise of today's "norm-free fantasies," the end of right and wrong, the total ascendancy of moral relativism, if nothing is real, then what limits any behavior? Is Sam saying anything new that isn't reflected in the fundamental ancient allegory of the golden calf?

> "Well, that's the Britannica's opinion," says another, "MY opinion is ..."

This is what Sam calls malignant egalitarianism. "Your PhD does not make you more of an expert in your domain than me. My opinions, no matter how uneducated I am, even in your domain of expertise, are inherently equal to yours. Every person's opinion whether a 13-year-old with a half formed brain that won't be complete until another 13 years goes by, or someone who has studied meticulously for 13 years to earn a PhD in a particular subject matter.

Opinions are being conflated with understandings. The opinion of a two-year-old is that poop belongs everywhere; on the wall, on the parent. The opinion of the 20-year-old mother is that it does not. Are all opinions equal? When do they become equal? At 3? At 8? At 13? Perhaps we could make an argument that once the brain has fully developed around the age of 26 that there is at least some physical equivalance, although the brain of a 13-year-long addict and the brain of a 13-year long PHD student at the equal age of 26 will not be equivalent, they will not have the same capacity for coherent thinking, until the drug-impaired brain gets repaired, then, perhaps, we can see equivalence develop again.

Those two *understandings*, the barely 13-year-old tweenage and 31-year-old newly minted PhD are empirically not equally sovereign, in terms of human agency development.

How dare you judge me for having an opinion that differs from you, rages the 13-year-old!? Your expertise gives you no right to expertise! [Insert the South Park Cartman "whateva, I'll do what I want" meme here].

Don't try to tell this to an addict, though. I wouldn't listen when I was addicted to various substances, so why would any other addict listen to me today? It makes sense that they resent me the same way I resented my parents and my extremely well-intentioned, clear-eyed, and unfortunately exasperated friends who eventually had to give up on me because I had given up on myself.

It's sad, but it makes sense.

Then, once the population of addicts reaches a certain majority threshold, a certain kind of idiocracy is free to take over, because now the addicted brains outnumber the non-addicted brains and can vote to enact an entire addict agenda.

How can we confer equality upon a mango tree sapling that is 4 ft tall and looks like a tree but is still 4 ft away from ever bearing fruit, was an 8-ft mango tree laden with fruit? Those two mango trees are only equivalent in kind, they are not equivalent in function or status, let alone lamentations that it wanted to be a papaya tree.

"The only way to reign in the next generation of social media which is immersive, solipsistic, anti-real, unreal, anti-reality, and value free, is a grassroots movement akin to the environmental movement. When people realize the dangers in the next generation of social media coupled with artificial intelligence, then money talks, then consumers talk, and then they can articulate a code of ethics."

I'm the meantime, "These platforms will become the haven of psychopaths and narcissists. Normal, healthy people will avoid these platforms because [these platforms] don't have a code of ethics," and such will self-identify accordingly.

Fascinating.

"This is the obligation of an intellectual. To say the truth as I see it and back it up with facts as I can find. That's my obligation. Intellectuals also betray their obligation because they also succumb to money. Money corrupted everything. You keep pushing me for solutions. I don't know."

"Joseph Schumpeter called it creative destruction. The structure we have constructed over the last three, four years is not going to stand, and there's no point in renovating it, painting it, calling the plumbers. We just need to start from scratch. I think we are well on the way."

"Maybe."

"Relationships in the age of social media, and in postmodern society, are performative. It's a performance to the benefit of other people. So your perform your relationship in front of friends, social media, fans, subscribers, followers. It's all a performance, which is very destructive to a relationship because you dedicate all of your energy and emotions and everything, *to the performance*, not to the relationship, and you expect your partner to collaborate with the performance and if he doesn't, you get very angry."

"We regard each other as objects and commodities. We consume each other. It's a consumption thing. The financial benefits that a partner can give you, or his status, the way he looks, you emphasize his looks, or his brain, or whatever [commoditized aspect that reflects well on you]. So, you regard people as objects to consume. It's a very selfish and self-interested view. Then, when they agree to play with us we construct a theater, a movie, which is very narcissistic, again. Modern relationships are a fantasy space. That's why people, when they break up, are very furious and angry and resentful and try to take revenge, and so on, because it's not reality that they've lost, it's the dream [that they have lost]. It's a dreamscape. Modern relationships are dreamscapes."

"People no longer live in reality, because reality's tough, reality is hard. Reality is hard work and compromises, it sucks most of the time. But fantasy, who wants to wake up from a dream? And if your partner forces you to wake up from a dream, you hate his guts and you want him dead. So, that's why people break up in a very bad way today, acrimoniously. I think we have exhausted the subject, ourselves and our viewers."

As always, do your own research, reach your own conclusions. In this case, [Vaknin Talks](https://vaknin-talks.com/) is an extraordinary resource presented by someone who, regardless whether we agree or disagree, is making his perspectives public for cross examination.

### "It seems the way of all development is that you either go up an abstraction just making CRUD apps or whatever, or you go down to the bare metal." &mdash; Ryan Donovon

> "I think there's [a higher abstraction layer](https://the-stack-overflow-podcast.simplecast.com/episodes/why-the-creator-of-nodejs-created-a-new-javascript-runtime/transcript?t=12m10s) that's starting to emerge ... where you can do fewer things but you can do them more easily. I guess I think of it as kind of a post-Unix future. Is there kind of an emerging abstraction layer that is not Unix that potentially we can program against in the future but much more rapidly? I think the jury's still out."

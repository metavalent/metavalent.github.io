Asymmetric power is not inherently evil. A parent and a child have an asymmetric power relationship. However, when asymmetric power, when asymmetric information, when asymmetric versions of the truth are used to deflect, deceive, or deny any mentally and emotionally stable person the inalienable right to informed consent, then asymmetric power is evil.

Equally, when asymmetric power is used to toy with the mentally or emotionally unstable, asymmetric power is grotesquely evil.

"A voodoo doll style version of you," acted upon by coercively asymmetric [captology](), a neologism of Stanford researcher BJ Fogg.

### Misandry as Default Consensus Dystopia

AND outcomes for single-father children are FAR superior to single-mother children.

AND this bleeds over into a trillion adjacent situations where the man is essentially *always* presumed to be a malefactor at the slightest expression of female displeasure. Especially destructive in intergenerational narcissistic family dynamics; however, just because that's the nuclear impact of socially sanctioned and even promoted personality disorders doesn't mean there aren't thousands of lesser munitions doing even greater damage, because they are *tiny little* emotional and psychological attacks that leave people increasingly isolated and vulnerable. How to find out in "he said, she said" situations? Look at who improved in social status and standing and who was decimated. Cui bono?

Watch [What Representing Men in Divorce Taught Me About Fatherhood | Marilyn York | TEDxUniversityofNevada](https://youtu.be/RlSwsE22nX0) if the embed does not behave nicely.

> "Attorney Marilyn York owns a Men‚Äôs Rights Family Law Firm in Reno Nevada, established in 2001. She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America's 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men's Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn't lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community" ([TEDxTalks](https://youtu.be/RlSwsE22nX0)).

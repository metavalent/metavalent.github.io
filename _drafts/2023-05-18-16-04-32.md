### From the don't-confuse-me-with-reality department

Those of us who were so mercilessly bullshited and bullied by the mobs at the time are still processing and probably will be for some time. The bullies will never apologize, they will only say "how could you know, you couldn't have known, we couldn't have known, it's not our fault." Despite all of this being fully known at the time by those who cared enough to look closely.

It was simple authoritarian frenzy the whole time and it's still Among Us and I just don't know how to ever change it. I just don't know.

I do know, that it can only start with hearing the words I'm sorry from those who browbeat us so mercilessly and accused of so heinously for speaking the truth.

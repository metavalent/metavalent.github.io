Conform or be cast out. Did anything like this ever happen when Jonas Salk invented the polio vaccine? No. Has anything like this ever happened with the introduction of any of the other vaccines that we receive as children? No.

Colbert says that people with natural immunity choosing not to get the vaccine will affect other people, but if those other people are vaccinated, they will not be affected, will they? So where is this 100% compliance or you may not participate in society coming from?

It couldn't possibly be the [comorbid control freak pandemic of narcissism](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2021/05/20/Narcissism-Pandemic.html) calling powerless people that don't want to comply with control freaks the the control freaks, could it?

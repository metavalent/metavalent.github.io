### Not above a little good old-fashioned "told you so" gloating after being voted off the island by a majority of one (plus 50 or 100 flying monkeys); essentially for exploring the very embodiment of these ideas, which echo my own of the past half decade

<h4>How to nurture self-awareness and self honesty without leading to self-destruction?</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.youtu.be/scKpJ3Rf3qE?t=2537s" target="_blank">42:17</a> I'm a holistic psychologist and it's like I think the fun is in the paradoxes of people and actually I would suggest that I think <strong><em>if everyone looked at themselves they'd find that they were paradoxical and the paradox is what we're scared to accept because it doesn't clearly define who you are</em></strong> and so it was easier for me to be a monk than who I am today where I'm like yeah I think like a monk but I don't live like one I adopt the practices of monks but I'm a married man I'm an entrepreneur and I enjoy all parts of that and I'm learning to allow myself to accept all parts of myself, but but <strong><em>I wonder why we're so scared of the paradoxes</em></strong> and how we can open ourselves up to actually realize the paradox has so much joy and potential in it ... does that ... and you can disagree with me too.<br />
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/scKpJ3Rf3qE?t=2582" target="_blank">43:02</a>I was smiling really big because it's I mean it's beautiful and what you're describing is how I describe the ego <strong><em>we all have this story of ourself that was formed at you know began its formation in childhood based on very real lived experiences and the feelings that we've had about them though it's a very contained it's only a story about an aspect or a part of who we are</em></strong> however it drops into our subconscious anything that goes against it feels threatening feels scary actually shakes my core sense of self I don't know who I am and to others right and so we then live our life in defense of that story though  for many of us that story like I said is is so small it might not even apply to the current situation or the current choices that we're making day in and day out so the goal really is to expand is to allow in right through honesty through witnessing all aspects of ourself because we all have all of those aspects of ourself and the way <strong><em>it mainly comes out is when we see an aspect ofourself in someone else and then we don't feel negatively about ourself because we deny that that's even in there, and then we project all of that negativity onto that person</em></strong> so that's oftentimes where I offer as a great point of exploration and i'll share one with you ...

One company isn't even shy about it. The company is literally called PREY. Not even shy about it. Just call remote workers what they've become: [PREY](https://preyproject.com/blog/en/employee-monitoring-surveillance-for-the-remote-work-era/ ). It's likely that the only people who don't realize that #RemoteWorkerSurveillance amounts to #HouseArrestJobs are so privileged that they don't know anyone in this situation.

But wait, there's more.

Managers turn to surveillance software, always-on webcams to ensure employees are (really) working from home
Always-on webcams, virtual “water coolers,” constant monitoring: [Is the tech industry’s new dream for remote work actually a nightmare?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/30/work-from-home-surveillance/)

Answer: Yes. Nightmare. Yes.

> "What people crave is human connection. These are the crumbs of human connection," he said. "You don’t end up extracting better, deeper, more creative work by subjecting people to ever harsher measures of surveillance."

> "Nearly half the U.S. labor force is now working from home, according to a study by MIT researchers in April. And many employees are probably **working longer and more sporadic hours than ever before**."

> A growing cottage industry of what some managers call **"tattleware"** now caters to company leaders wanting some way to peer over workers’ shoulders and confirm their productivity. Several time-tracking and employee-monitoring companies, including ActivTrak, Hubstaff, Time Doctor and Teramind, told The Washington Post they have seen their customer base and revenue soar since the pandemic pushed many companies remote."

> "InterGuard’s system can also **record all of the workers’ emails, instant messages and keystrokes, and takes pictures of workers’ screens as frequently as every five seconds**, which managers can review as they please. “You could literally watch a movie of what that person did,” said Brad Miller, chief executive of the system’s Connecticut-based parent company, Awareness Technologies."


Remote work isn't less demanding, it requires even MORE engagement, [according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2021/12/27/this-is-the-future-of-remote-work-in-2021/?sh=ce8d1131e1de).

While common sense psychology for human well being is obvious. "Often forgotten as working remote typically yields you thinking that if you aren’t in front of that computer 24/7, you are not being productive. When you were [in the office, how many times would you stand up to walk around, grab something to drink, have a snack](https://preyproject.com/blog/en/employee-monitoring-surveillance-for-the-remote-work-era/ ), go out for lunch? Keep the same routine while working from home, your brain and well-being needs the rest."

There is no keeping the same routine in today's remote work _worst practice_ best practice.

Combine with [robots that will make sure you get back to your quarters](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alliekmiller_i-cant-be-the-only-one-that-likes-watching-activity-6786004461224542208-IcxG), and voila! Terminator dystopia achievement unlocked! Can't make this up. The desensitization program has begun. 

[Employers Are Using Surveillance Tech to Spy on Remote Workers](https://truthout.org/articles/employers-are-using-surveillance-tech-to-spy-on-remote-workers/)

> "Dis­turb­ing increas­es in use of dig­i­tal sur­veil­lance tech­nolo­gies by employ­ers to mon­i­tor their remote work­ers is rais­ing alarm bells. With the num­ber of remote work­ers surg­ing as a result of the pan­dem­ic — 42% of U.S. work­ers are now doing their jobs from their kitchens, liv­ing rooms and home offices  —  a num­ber of employ­ers have begun requir­ing their work­ers to down­load spy­ing soft­ware to their lap­tops and smart­phones. The goal is for busi­ness­es to mon­i­tor what their remote employ­ees do all day, and to track job per­for­mance and pro­duc­tiv­i­ty and reduce so-called ​'cyber-slack­ing.'"

### Function

https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Stigmergy

> Stigmergy = environmental mechanisms to coordinate the work of independent actors (cfr. Hint-based Systems)

> Stigmergic collaboration is essential to the success of large-scale online collaboration projects. To qualify as stigmergy, agents cannot communicate directly with one another, but rather must engage indirectly via a medium.


### Trails

> Before considering the dynamic aspect of stigmergic systems, let's now look more closely at the trails. These are the means by which ants and users of a stigmergic system transfer their information to the landscape or environment.

> Ants enter information into a landscape by laying a trail of special protein elements called pheromones. Humans enter information into a computer environment by leaving a trail of binary digits in their computer's memory.

> Here humans have a great advantage over ants because they can create a formatted landscape in which trails can be laid. This will allow the landscape to be divided and subdivided into many identifiable regions, with all regions accessible by means of a hierarchical routing structure. The ability to be able to format the landscape allows us to specify where people lay their trails. In effect, this is putting the categorization processing into the landscape, removing the need for this to be carried out by a backend database procedure.

> The concept of stigmergy has been used to analyze self-organizing activities in an ever-widening range of domains, including social insects, robotics, web communities and human society. Yet, it is still poorly understood and as such its full power remains underappreciated.

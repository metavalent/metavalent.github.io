Github Flavored Markdown Cheat Sheet
https://github.github.com/gfm/

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as
bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly,
Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax, GFM, that provides an additional set of useful
features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

LISTS
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 2a
* Item 2b

HEADERS
BLOCKQUOTES
As Grace Hopper said:
> I’ve always been more interested
> in the future than in the past.

LISTS
Ordered / Unordered
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
* Item 3a
* Item 3b

BACKSLASH ESCAPES
Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which
would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown’s formatting syntax.
Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:

\ backslash
` backtick
* asterisk
_ underscore
{} curly braces
[] square brackets
() parentheses
# hash mark
+ plus sign
- minus sign (hyphen)
. dot
! exclamation mark

EMPHASIS
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
*You **can** combine them*
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
\*literal asterisks\*


USERNAME / MENTIONS
Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment.

This is called an “@mention”, because you’re mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization.

ISSUE REFERENCES
Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically converted into a link.

#1
github-flavored-markdown#1
defunkt/github-flavored-markdown#1

TASK LISTS
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](),
**formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)


FENCED CODE BLOCKS
Markdown coverts text with four leading spaces into a code block; with GFM you can
wrap your code with ``` to create a code block without the leading spaces. Add an
optional language identifier and your code will get syntax highlighting.

```javascript
function test() {
console.log("look ma’, no spaces");
}
```

TABLES
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - 
(for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe | :

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content cell 1 | Content cell 2
Content column 1 | Content column 2

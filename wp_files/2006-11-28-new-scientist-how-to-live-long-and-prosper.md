An even stronger predictor of longevity was how young their mother was when they were born. Those whose mothers were less than 25 years old were twice as likely to survive beyond a century."

So, I'm prolly screwing up a million other variables, but at least I'm batting 1000 on two with which I had absolutely no role in causing, whatsoever. Better to be lucky than good, I guess.

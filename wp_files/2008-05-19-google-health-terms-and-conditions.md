Introductory sardonics slightly updated on 6/9/08. :-)

Yeah, so just gloss over the fine print below. Granted, <em>technically</em> and <em>actually</em>, the T&amp;C's are indeed prominently displayed on the Google Health sign-up page, in readily-ignorable undersized textarea boxes that might scroll on forever. So, just go ahead and click on the big, inviting, colorful, shiny, safe, and attractive "Go to your new health profile" button, as usual. Don't worry, you're not alone; nobody reads the T&amp;C's. Just Trust Us, it'll be great. We're Google, after all. 

Don't you just <em>love</em> that word, anyway? Google. It's just so darned ... <em>googly</em> ... and it's still <em>so damned cute</em> every single time I say it or hear it. Great googly, oogly, boogly, koogle, oogly-moogly ... awww ... it's just like the most friendly and unquestionably loyal fluffy furry little puppy, isn't it? And after all, what could a cute and fluffily little waggily puppily ever do to harm something as vital and personal as your entire medical record, right?

Google's Licensors may be third party beneficiaries to this agreement.  There are no other third party beneficiaries to this agreement. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in this agreement creates an agency, partnership, or joint venture.

If Google provides you with a translation of the English language version of this agreement, the English language version of this agreement will control if there is any conflict.

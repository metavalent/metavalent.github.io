Time Warner to Make AOL Services Free

"Time Warner this morning confirmed its AOL unit will give away e-mail, software and other Web services for free to high-speed Internet users in a bid to boost online advertising sales, in what Reuters notes is the fourth overhaul of the online service in five years. The media conglomerate also said its quarterly results swung to a profit of $1.01 billion from a loss of $409 million a year earlier, when it booked a litigation-related charge. The profit growth was led by strong performances at its cable and network-television operations, the company said" (WSJ.Com, subscription required).

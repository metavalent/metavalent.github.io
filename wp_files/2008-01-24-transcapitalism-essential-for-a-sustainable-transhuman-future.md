Remember these from <a href="http://metavalent.info/?p=623">11/25/07</a> and <a href="http://metavalent.info/?p=627">12/1/07</a>? Today, on <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120113473219511791.html">1/24/08</a>, we learn more. <blockquote>With today's speech, Mr. Gates adds his high-profile name to the ranks of those who argue that unfettered capitalism can't solve broad social problems.</blockquote>Yes, comrades, phat Billy G is in da' house.<br /><br />Either Bill is paying attention to this lowly blog, or reason simply reaches the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120113473219511791.html">same conclusion</a>, independent of the identity of the conscious exerciser thereof.<br /><br />I vote for the latter, but thanks for the encouragement. Although, it is a bit uncanny that Gates agrees that we can do all this without changing the mechanics of markets, the foundational tenet of my proposals. We simply need Enlightened Free Agents to act upon their better consciences.<blockquote>Key to Mr. Gates's plan will be for businesses to dedicate their top people to poor issues -- an approach he feels is more powerful than traditional corporate donations and volunteer work. Governments should set policies and disburse funds to create financial incentives for businesses to improve the lives of the poor, he plans to say today. "If we can spend the early decades of the 21st century finding approaches that meet the needs of the poor in ways that generate profits for business, we will have found a sustainable way to reduce poverty in the world," Mr. Gates plans to say.<br /><br />In the interview, Mr. Gates was emphatic that he's not calling for a fundamental change in how capitalism works. He cited Adam Smith, whose treatise, "The Wealth of Nations," lays out the rationale for the self-interest that drives capitalism and companies like Microsoft. That shouldn't change, "one iota," Mr. Gates said.</blockquote>As humans transcend, economics simply must transcend. There should be a billion beta tests of all kinds of creative, productive, fun, and even entertaining methods and experiments for finally taming this historically harsh overlord of poverty and plenty.<br /><br />The methods and means may be myriad, the goals remain the same, both here at home <a href="http://metavalent.info/?p=627">in America</a>, and as responsible <a href="http://www.joinred.com/red/">global citizens</a>: Liberte, Egalite, Augmente, Fraternite.<br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p>

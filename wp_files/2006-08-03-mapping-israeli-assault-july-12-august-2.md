I don't know if the idea of "proportionate response" really helps the debate when one is seeking to annhilate another -- for whatever reason -- but if nothing else, the maps here help to provide a better context for what is happening.

Truth be told, and various kneejerk rants aside, I'm as confused as you are about how to respond to all of this; my heart and mind are a mishmash of reason, emotion, sound judgement, moral outrage, and yet all I can really do for now is seek more DATA in order to eventually form some kind of fact-based perspective on all of this.  It's just a phcking mess, man.  A phcking disaster. <a href="http://sanfrancisco.tribe.net/listing/Mapping-Israeli-Assault-July-12-August-2/san-francisco-ca/1c54b4f5-ecef-4d8c-8f64-bdd9982656cb">Mapping Israeli Assault: July 12-August 2</a>.

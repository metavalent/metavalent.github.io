<blockquote>"Just as Copernicus's heliocentric notion of universe is now bedrock truth, the Neuro Revolution will bring about new ideas of human spirituality that will forever reshape our  understanding of humanity's role and place the universe. A quiet  transformation has begun, albeit one that may take centuries to play out fully" (Lynch, 152. <a href="http://www.theneurorevolution.com/">The Neuro Revolution</a>.).</blockquote><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/46813052@N00/189736044" title="autism neuroimaging study"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/67/189736044_4c0d087f40.jpg" /></a>

In June 2022, I met two Andrews at Salt Pond. One was a web3/nft advocate who suggested <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/90736483621683311863452452737355470352731486584043330897208667317918259740673/">OpenSea</a>. Another needed kālā simply to survive the day. $25 USD was exchanged for this <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/90736483621683311863452452737355470352731486584043330897208667317918259740673/">unique artistic artifact</a>, thereby creating value out of what some might consider trash and enabling Andrew, as a curator of alien artifact art to procure some fraction of his basic material needs for the day. The rest of the story is yours and ours to co-create and share ... magnify value back to its source ... how do we circulate all future value created back to the Salt Pond community?

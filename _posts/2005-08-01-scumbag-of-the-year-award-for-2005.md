Goes to (hopefully very soon to be former) columnist Robert Novak for <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/08/01/politics/main713132.shtml">Naming CIA Officer</a> and then claiming that "no CIA official ever told him in advance 'that Valerie Plame Wilson's disclosure would endanger her or anybody else.'"  As one of the most senior veterans in his trade, nobody needed to say a word HE KNEW and he's therefore the 2005 Scumbag of the Year for AWCD.

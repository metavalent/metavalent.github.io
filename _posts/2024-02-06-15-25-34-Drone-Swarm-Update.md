### OSU and OFFensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics (OFFSET).

> Research involving Oregon State University has shown that [a ‚Äúswarm‚Äù of more than 100 autonomous ground and aerial robots can be supervised by one person](https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/one-person-can-supervise-%E2%80%98swarm%E2%80%99-100-unmanned-autonomous-vehicles-osu-research-shows) without subjecting the individual to an undue workload.

> DARPA‚Äôs [OFFensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics (OFFSET)](https://www.darpa.mil/program/offensive-swarm-enabled-tactics) program envisions future small-unit infantry forces using swarms comprising upwards of 250 small unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) and/or small unmanned ground systems (UGSs) to accomplish diverse missions in complex urban environments. By leveraging and combining emerging technologies in swarm autonomy and human-swarm teaming, the program seeks to enable rapid development and deployment of breakthrough capabilities.

Not that my readers could have possibly missed it by now, but thanks to the <a href="https://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/MSD-nanoradio.html">empirically ineffable accomplishments of physicist Alex Zettl and graduate student Kenneth Jensen</a> the nano-genie is now SO out of the bottle that it won't be long now before the normals start telling us how <a href="https://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pister/SmartDust/">smart dust</a> was so intuitively obvious all along. I'm actually getting comfortable with that whole cycle. Who knew?

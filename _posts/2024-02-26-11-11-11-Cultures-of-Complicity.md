> Always follow the money of gambling-addicted alcoholic international bankers, film industry creeps, bought judges, and shifty-shady-shameless, busibody-duck-n-shuffling, remorseless, pathological, complicit cowpoke communities that betray fidelity, trust, and oaths to *First, Do No Harm*, much less *To Protect and To Serve*.

Seems like the one screaming "[You can't handle the truth!](https://youtu.be/9FnO3igOkOk)" loudest is generally the one that can't handle the truth. While Jessup seems to make compelling, valid, and difficult-to-deal-with points in a world that still includes war, if he could have admitted a tragic mistake and shown some remorse, it might have redeemed him to some extent. But authoritarian control freaks of all kinds prefer to do the [DARVO](https://gender.stanford.edu/news/youve-been-darvoed-and-you-dont-even-know-it); screaming, berating, gaslighting, and bullying the person calling them on misbehavior. P.S DARVO is due for a update to include all forms of blame-shifting in cultures of complicity. Communal narcissitic triangulation, emotional, psychological, and social-engineering abuse, among others.

Semper Fi.

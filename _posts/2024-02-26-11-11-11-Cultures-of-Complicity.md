Watch [This Scientist catches FRAUD in Harvard and Stanford Research](https://youtu.be/GeAPtIdb4Qs) if the embed does not behave nicely. Bonus commentary by an ethical psychologist on the pandemic of [breaches of informed consent](https://youtu.be/6r-YEv3917c?t=4m55s).

> Always follow the money of gambling-addicted alcoholic international bankers, film industry creeps, bought judges, and shifty-shady-shameless, busibody-duck-n-shuffling, remorseless, pathological, complicit cowpoke communities that betray fidelity, trust, and oaths to *First, Do No Harm*, much less *To Protect and To Serve*.

While [the truth upsets people sometimes](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2024-02-27-11-11-11-The-Truth-Upsets-People.html) and it seems like the one screaming "[You can't handle the truth!](https://youtu.be/9FnO3igOkOk)" loudest is generally the one that can't handle the truth. And while scornful screamers are expert at making compelling, morally ambiguating, and orthogonal relativizing points in a world where *people are no damned good*, making war and such; if screamers could admit to tragic mistakes and show some remorse, it might begin a road to redemption. But authoritarian control freaks of all genders prefer to dance the [DARVO](https://dynamic.uoregon.edu/jjf/defineDARVO.html); screaming, berating, gaslighting, and bullying the person calling them on misbehavior. In fact, new findings suggest DARVO can be particularly vicious in same-sex relationships; intimate or otherwise.

Semper Fi.

*P.S DARVO is due for a update to include all forms of blame-shifting in cultures of complicity. Communal narcissitic triangulation, emotional, psychological, and social-engineering abuse, among others.*

> Always follow-the-money of gambling-addicted alcoholic international bankers, film industry creeps, bought judges, and shifty-shady-shameless, busibody-duck-n-shuffling, remorseless, pathological, complicit cowpoke communities that betray fidelity, trust, and oaths to *First, Do No Harm*, much less *To Protect and To Serve*.

While [the truth upsets people sometimes](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2024-02-27-11-11-11-The-Truth-Upsets-People.html) and it seems like the one screaming "[You can't handle the truth!](https://youtu.be/9FnO3igOkOk)" loudest is generally the one that can't handle the truth. And while scornful screamers are expert at making compelling, morally ambiguating, and orthogonal relativizing points in a world where *people are no damned good*, making war and such; if screamers could admit to tragic mistakes and show some remorse, it might begin a road to redemption. But authoritarian control freaks of all genders prefer to dance the DARVO;<sup>\[2\]</sup> screaming, berating, gaslighting, and bullying the person calling them on misbehavior. In fact, new findings suggest DARVO can be particularly vicious in same-sex relationships; intimate or otherwise.

> "A substantial minority of \[DARVO\] perpetrators (21.5% of men and 17.0% of women) denied that any argument with their partner had taken place at all. The vast majority of perpetrators (82.6% of men and 86.2% of women) responded with at least one form of minimization of the incident, agreeing, for example, that the ‚Äúsituation got blown way out of proportion.‚Äù Over half of the perpetrators reported at least one item corresponding to victim blaming, with the most frequently endorsed victim-blaming item implicating that *the VICTIM had ‚Äúa problem with jealousy.‚Äù*<sup>\[3\]</sup>

Semper Fi.

*P.S DARVO is due for a update to include all forms of blame-shifting in cultures of complicity. Communal narcissitic triangulation, emotional, psychological, and social-engineering abuse, among others.*

Herb Greenberg might be too modest to yelp I TOLD YOU SO, but I'm not.

We soooo f***ing TOLD   YOU   SO.  This is truly some of the sweetest news of the post-dotcom decade.  Die, AOL, Die.  And may it be a long, and utterly miserable death that ends up, in the end, COSTING MORE THAN ALL THE HISTORIC GAINS COMBINED.  The injustice is that it won't cost Steve Case his entire fortune; but it should.  

AOL wasn't just a sham and a charade, it's razor-wire enclosed prison yard model -- euphemistically referred to as walled garden -- caused tremendous HARM by constricting subscriber's ability to explore the REAL internet.

<blockquote>In what would mark a dramatic shift in strategy, Time Warner Inc.'s AOL unit is considering offering its entire menu of services, including email, free of charge to anyone with a high-speed Internet connection, people familiar with the matter said.</blockquote>

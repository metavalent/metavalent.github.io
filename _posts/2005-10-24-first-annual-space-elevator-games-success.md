I was privileged this weekend to put in three 14 hour days volunteering with the <a href="http://www.spaceward.org"> Spaceward Foundation</a>'s inaugural Space Elevator Games 2005.  This event was the Kitty Hawk for the coming era of safe, reliable, lowcost, quotidian access to space.  By augmenting traditional rocket-based lift systems with the <a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/aug05/1690">space elevator</a>, or "train to space" as the Russians envisioned in the 1940's, the pace of space development will increase rapidly as cost-per-pound of payload drops by a factor of 100 or more.  Here are a few of the post-games write-ups:

Like Kitty Hawk, the success at the first annual Space Elevator games was not actually the first successful demonstration of the concept.  Many other groups like the <a href="http://www.gwinnettdailyonline.com/GDP/archive/article9A4C4E3D1C7643018713A48969410C21.asp">LiftPort Group</a> of Bremerton, WA have been working on the concept for several years.

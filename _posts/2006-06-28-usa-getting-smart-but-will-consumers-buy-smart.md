In contrast to the recent bull market in stupidity we've seen here lately, the  <a href="https://www.usa.smart.com/">SMART</a> car is coming to the US in 2008.  These cars make a tremendous amount of sense for dense urban markets like the peninsula, NYC, Boston, etc., but it remains to be seen whether WEALTHY consumers will be smart enough to buy these things early-on, so that economies of scale can eventually be realized.  Like every new technology, the price starts higher than most can afford and a relatively thin slice of consumers decide -- by voting with their dollars -- which ones will go on to be available to everyone.  So be smart, bell-cow consumers, go out and <a href="https://www.smartusa.com/">place your pre-orders</a> today.

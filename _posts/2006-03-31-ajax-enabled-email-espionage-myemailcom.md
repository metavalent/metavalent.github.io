The pitch is that you can <a href="http://www.myemail.com/">Check Email from Anywhere in the World!</a>  Am I the only one in the world who thinks this is a Pretty Bad idea?  If you log in here with your company email address, you've just given these folks direct access to your email.  You have no idea who's running the show at myemail.com, but you sign up because it's flashy ajaxy.  At the very least, companies better clue in to this and make it formally grounds for a good rap on the knuckles with a thick wooden ruler; preferably the kind with embedded paper cutter.

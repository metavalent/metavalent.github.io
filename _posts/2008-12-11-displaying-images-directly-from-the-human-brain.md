As we've said for years ... just gimme the I/O ports ...<blockquote>Researchers at the ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories succeeded in <a href="https://www.physorg.com/news148193433.html">processing and displaying images directly from the human brain</a>, they said in a study unveiled ahead of publication in the US magazine Neuron.

While the team for now has managed to reproduce only simple images from the brain, they said the technology could eventually be used to figure out dreams and other secrets inside people's minds.

"By applying this technology, it may become possible to record and replay subjective images that people perceive like dreams."

In their experiment, the researchers showed people the six letters in the word "neuron" and then succeeded in reconstructing the letters on a computer screen by measuring their brain activity.

The team said that it first figured out people's individual brain patterns by showing them some 400 different still images.</blockquote>

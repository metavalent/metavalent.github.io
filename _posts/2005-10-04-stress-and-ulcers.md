EVERYONE knows that stress causes ulcers, right?

Except that <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4933608">it doesn't</a>, and the clueful have known this fact since 1982.  That group did not include me until just today, which leaves me embarrased, indeed.  Perhaps I can yet take consolation in that I'm only 23 years behind the times in a society where many are at least 100 years behind.

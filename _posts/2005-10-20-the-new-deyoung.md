<a href="http://www.thinker.org/">Just go</a>.  Trust me.  The decade long project to <a href="http://thinker.org/deyoung/">re-open the deYoung</a> culminated in a masterpiece of sociological logistics during the 31 hour public unveiling party held last weekend, October 15-16.  The splendor and diversity of the collection was matched only by the splendor and diversity of the throngs that wafted through the spacious galleries day, and night, and day.  Easily one of the coolest large scale public events I've ever attended.

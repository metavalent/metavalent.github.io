<a href="https://www.fightaging.org/archives/001517.php">FightingAging</a> reports:<blockquote>Researcher Attila Chordash is back from last weekend's Aging 2008 conference, and he's <a href="https://pimm.wordpress.com/2008/07/04/aubrey-de-grey-on-aging-2008-the-disease-the-cure-and-the-implications/">posted his video</a> of biomedical gerontologist Aubrey de Grey's presentation from a vantage point at the pre-conference public event.</blockquote>And Reason puts it ever aptly:<blockquote>[It's] the <a href="https://www.fightaging.org/archives/001517.php">concert bootleg scene, except with scientists</a> instead of musicians, and no bouncers chasing down the camcorders - you'll see what I mean when you watch it.</blockquote>

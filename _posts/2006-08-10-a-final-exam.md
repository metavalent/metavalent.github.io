Hey, I'm just saying what millions of people think every day, but they're AFRAID to say it.

Sure, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8718728501056290731">this is all real funny</a> and such, HOWEVER, if this is truly what was indeed turned in (and probably accepted) as a "final" for ANY high school class other than amateur video production, then I do believe, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that the following qualifies as exhibit #1 toward proving the pathologically dysfunctional state of public education in America.  Maybe it's funny as a video, but it's BEYOND REVOLTING as a reflection of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8718728501056290731">what is going on in American high schools</a> in the name of education.

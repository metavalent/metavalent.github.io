On the first or second day after Katrina there was a picture on CNN of an isolated white man's carcass who had just been beaten to the very verge of, if not entirely to death.

A Briton on holiday reported, "It was very dangerous - rioting, looting of vending machines, <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4214746.stm">racial abuse</a>, absolutely terrible sanitary conditions."

Yes, among other ugly underpinnings of the U.S. deep South, an ongoing rampant racism was exposed by Katrina.  What was also made abundantly clear is that the word racist is certainly NOT synonymous with white, a point that I doubt will gain sufficient, if any attention in the media.

Snagged this one off the KurzweilAI feed, <a href="https://metavalent.info/#ai">below</a>.  If you haven't <a href="https://metavalent.info/#ai">scrolled down</a>, why not <a href="https://metavalent.info/#ai">give it a try</a>?

And don't worry.  The <a href="https://blog.wired.com/androidclone/index.album?i=3">Android Clones</a> are only the most basic -- though doubtless essential -- of building blocks.  Even once we've accomplished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading">Mind Uploading</a>, the psychological experience of existing in a <a href="https://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html">Substrate Independent</a> body is what will seperate the next evolutionary strain of humanity from the less adapative.  That's where today's <a href="https://wired.com/news/technology/0,71426-0.html?tw=wn_index_3">Remote-Control Self</a> becomes essential as an experimental training platform.  The initial stages of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading">mind transfer</a> into a new substrate will be very awkward and disorienting, to say the least, unless that new substrate is an EXACT genetic replica.  Surely that could be one scenario, but it is not the only scenario, and even then we don't really know what the result would be like.  After all, EXACT is a very exacting ideal, indeed.

Short of that ideal case, only those humans possessing a TREMENDOUS amount of concentration and patience will have the slightest chance of adapting.  

So, the uber rich might be the first guinea pigs in the posthuman future, but Natural Selection will weed them out as well.  So, the only option will be to <a href="https://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/92a.lifabsphe.html">Adapt and Transcend</a>, or sayonara.

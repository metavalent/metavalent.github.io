Subject: [SALT] Synthetic biology debate next MONDAY Nov. 17

NOTE: This is on MONDAY eve, Nov. 17, not the usual Friday.

Synthetic Biology has advanced much faster and farther than most people realize, reminiscent of what happened when personal computers took off.  Amateurs all over the world are programming bacteria and viruses to do strange and wonderful things, or strange and dangerous things, depending on your point of view.  Corporations are developing new life forms for purposes that are noble or insidious, depending on your point of view...

Cowell Theater, Fort Mason, San Francisco

As some dystopian authors predicted, poor people are being targeted with campaigns for them to sell their own body parts.   The fact that these public forums are happening IN PUBLIC is a likely indicator that the problem must be way out of hand, already.

    One of the most profitable new industries that arose in the late 20th and early 21st centuries derives from the numerous uses identified for human tissue. Until the spring of 2005, the federal government scarcely regulated this market, despite the routine governmental regulation of the organ transplantation industry. Ultimately, evidence of predatory practices by some actors in the tissue transplant business led the government to issue regulations governing the solicitation of human tissue from surviving family members. The foundation of these new federal regulations is the belief that mandating greater disclosure by those who solicit donations will insulate families from the risks of exploitation. This paper argues that these regulations, as drafted, offer too little protection to the families, and in addition, generate a threat to the entire organ and tissue transplant industry.

<a href="https://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&amp;id=news/aw012808p1.xml">Aviation Week reporting</a>:<blockquote>&quot;... in the Darpa experiments, the computer is just a tool that processes brain waves, of which <strong>the human being isn&rsquo;t even aware</strong>, and turns them into actionable information.&quot;</blockquote>Brilliant as a means for managing cognitive overload ... for extending our ability to act and interact beyond our limited sensory sphere. I'll have to update this post with link to lecture at UCB that explores this ESSENTIAL functionality for any aspiring metaposttranshuman. :-)

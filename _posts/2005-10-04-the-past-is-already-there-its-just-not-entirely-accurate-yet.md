Having used the nearly ubiquitous tagline in that last post, my curiousity piqued. Hence, the title of this particular post, which is indeed mine, and it appears here first. On the other hand, the subject matter of this title is a bit more ambiguous in letter, if not substance: <a href="http://www.brianstorms.com/archives/000461.html">"As I've said many times, the future is already here. It's just not very evenly distributed."</a> -- quotation by William Gibson, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1067220">really</a>

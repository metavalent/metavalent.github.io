``This is an important breakthrough,'' if other scientists confirm the method works without harming embryos, said Arnold Kriegstein, who directs the Institute for Regeneration Medicine at the University of California-San Francisco.

White House officials released a statement in response to Advanced Cell Technology's announcement that said, ``It is encouraging to see scientists making serious efforts to move away from research that involves the destruction of embryos.'' But it added, ``Any use of human embryos for research purposes raises serious ethical concerns. This technique does not resolve all those concerns.''

Puh-lease ... yes it DOES resolve them, and more.  Particularly since a zygote is NOT a human, in the first place; despite superstitious tribal native "beliefs."  This entire business of "beliefs" overriding EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS has got to come to an end, soon.  Sure, you can *have* your beliefs all that you like, but you man *not* trample upon physical observations and measurements of REALITY.

From the <a href="https://blog.intentionalsoftware.com/intentional_software/2007/02/sustaining_rela.html">Intentional Software blog</a>:<blockquote>In their 2005 book John Seely Brown and John Hagel III advise that The Only Sustainable Edge for a business is to accelerate and leverage distinctive capabilities and knowledge. They advise each business to work closely with others in networks of companies that have diverse, complementary capabilities, and to build long-term, reciprocal, trust-based relationships through shared meaning. </blockquote>Why is this subject deemed metavalent in nature? Because <a href="https://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/careers/846252-29.html">the very structure of business</a>, moving toward a substrate-independent world, must itself evolve or die. Market capitalism, industrial organization, corporate structures, like all human constructs, are anything but immutable. The most stable processes and procedures are often the most petrified -- long-dead means and methods that indeed flourished for a period of time, but their continued presence in petrified form is not exactly evidence of continued viability.

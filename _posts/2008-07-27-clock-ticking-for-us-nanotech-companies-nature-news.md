The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a deadline of Monday 28 July for US companies to <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080725/full/news.2008.983.html?s=news_rss">voluntarily hand over details about the nanoparticles they work with</a>. Yet very few companies have participated, leaving the EPA more likely to move towards mandatory regulation, something the industry fears will be bad for business.

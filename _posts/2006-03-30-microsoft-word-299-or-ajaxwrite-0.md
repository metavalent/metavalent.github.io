 Microsoft Office Professional 2007 - $499

<a href="https://www.ajaxwrite.com/">ajaxWrite - $0</a>

I guarantee you will be <i>Blown Away</i> at how fast this application performs (provided it's not being hammered by DIGG or SLASHDOT).  If unavailable when you first try, definitely try again later.  Once they can afford server capacity, this looks like quite a contender to <a href="https://writely.com/">Writely</a>.  Ain't competition grand?

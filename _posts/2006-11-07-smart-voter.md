Every state should have a site like <a href="https://smartvoter.org/" target="_blank">Smart Voter</a>, which presently covers elections in California, Ohio, and now, New York. 

<a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/" target="_blank">VerifiedVoting.org</a> champions reliable and publicly verifiable elections in the United States. A very pertinent issue in an age of questionable, first generation Direct Recording Electronic" (DRE) devices, to use industry jargon for computerized voting equipment.

<a href="https://electiononline.org/" target="_blank">ElectionOnline.org</a>, produced by the Election Reform Information Project, is the nationâ€™s only non-partisan, non-advocacy website providing up-to-the-minute news and analysis on election reform.

Wish I had the time and patience to do more civic work, but I just don't. I read most of the ridiculously lengthy California Voter Guide (an exercise that I suspect less than 2% of voters actually have time to complete), sent in the permanent absentee ballot on Saturday, and posted this on election day. That's about all the patriotic civic duty I can must for one election season.

In the age of Medium, Substack, Patreon, and new platforms like PanQuake, being a writer in the #PostAutomationEra is becoming something entirely different that it has ever been, before. If it wasn't easy in the past, imagine the futility in the context of a constantly chatter global brain monkey mind.

So, [Why Even Bother](https://writingcooperative.com/why-bother-being-a-writer-421d707daefd)?

Good question. I differ with a lot of Kathryn Van Auken's work, but I like her answer to this question:

> We have to make sense of our experiences and share them with others, so we will all feel less alone and perhaps ease suffering in others; either through shared stories, or through pure entertainment. We want to offer a reprieve from this chaotic world.
> That compulsion is why we write, despite the discouragements and hardships, because not writing is much more painful than failing at it.
> That’s my answer, what’s yours?

- "The only reason to write is because you have no choice."
- "Write for yourself. If anyone else cares, that's just a bonus."
- "There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you." - Maya Angelou
- "If you have any young friends who aspire to become writers, the second greatest favor you can do them is to present them with copies of The Elements of Style. The first greatest, of course, is to shoot them now, while they’re happy." - Dorothy Parker

When will these thick-headed Americans get it through their skulls?  There is such a HUGE difference between "horrifying" and "terrifying" ... I mean, this guy didn't MEAN to terrorize, only to brutalize; so the fact that the entire community is terrorized is merely horrifying; and not threatening to national security only to THEIR security, so it's all okay, it's not terrorism.  Unless we find out he was a Muslim; or maybe he had 1/64th Arabic blood or something ... THEN it would be terrorism; but for now, according to all the people with requisite badges, uniforms, and job titles on their business cards, this local act of terror was only 'pretty horrific.' So, I guess that makes it safe to go back to school in the morning; after all, it's not like this was TERRORISM or anything really bad like that. <a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15057589/">School gunman left suicide note</a>.

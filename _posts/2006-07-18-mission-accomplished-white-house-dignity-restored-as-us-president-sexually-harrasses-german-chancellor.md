Well, what can we say, but <a href="http://video.msn.com/v/us/msnbc.htm?g=CA61956D-231F-4AEF-963B-D5D92E9939A9&amp;f=00&amp;fg=copy">Mission Accomplished</a>.  Imagine what the Moral Moron Majority would have had to say if that were Bill Clinton sizing up the German meat market!?  Here's another take on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dfrHT8o-0A">YouTube</a> if that first link gives you any trouble.  This isn't the least bit funny, it is the essence of male chauvinism in the workplace.  I cannot even COMPREHEND how inappropriate this was.  Was it also inappropriate for Bill Clinton to do what he did?  Of course.  But we are talking about GROPING the Chancellor of Germany, here!  Unbelievable!

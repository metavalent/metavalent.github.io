<!--Lead Photo --><a href="http://linktv.org/mosaic/"><img src="http://metavalent.info/images/linktv.logo.jpg" align="left" border="0" alt="0" /></a><!-- Commentary --><a href="http://linktv.org/mosaic/streamsArchive/index.php4">Link TV - Mosaic</a> provides an overview of news coverage from Al Jazeera and other leading middle east news networks.  REQUIRED viewing for any westerner who aspires to gaining even HALF  a clue about what is going on in the middle east.  Sure, it's "their" propaganda, but it's no less valid to "them" than "our" propaganda is, to "us."  Thanks to ETHERNET TV, more people than ever can finally gain access to more perspectives than ever.

What we DO with this expanded context, of course, remains to be seen.  If the world had Massive Symmetric Bandwidth, the phenomenon would be multiplied exponentially, as anyone with a net connection could upload (PROVIDE) content as easily as we've historically downloaded (CONSUMED) content.  So, while sites like LinkTV represent a significant forward stride, it's still little more than Eastern Asymmetric Information Packaging meets Western Asymmetric Information Packaging.

The Revolution begins when the entire world finally gains access to affordable, univeral, SYMMETRIC broadband.  Perhaps that is why select western multinational telecoms are presently working feverishly to roll back decades of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">Net Neutrality</a>, before it's too late.  If handled correctly, on the other hand, this issue of Net Neutrality could be the final blow to the old incumbent model of Central Services command and control for global Information Transit.

Yes it does; but it don't mean we need to dance to it.

Tangents are always relevant because they touch precisely on the circle of the present moment. - The Unknown Ultracrepidarian

She never needed that BUM anyway, right? That's right. All men are pigs. ALL. Remember that, fans. ALL. FOREVER. No exceptions, right? Right. Because she's *always* right, right? They're *always* right, right? Right. That's right. Being right is *way* more important than [peace, love, and understanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssd3U_zicAI), right?

#### Lyrics:

Chorus:
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
Drums keep pounding
A rhythm to the brain
La de da de de, la de da de da

Charleston was once the rage, uh huh
History has turned the page, uh huh
The mini skirts the current thing, uh huh
Teenybopper is our newborn king, uh huh

[Chorus]

The grocery store's the super mart, uh huh
Little girls still break their hearts, uh huh
And men still keep on marching off to war
Electrically they keep a baseball score

[Chorus]

Grandmas sit in chairs and reminisce
Boys keep chasing girls to get a kiss
The cars keep going faster all the time
Bums still cry, "Hey buddy,
have you got a dime?"

[Chorus]

#### Lyrics:

You got me runnin' goin' out of my mind,
You got me thinkin' that I'm wastin' my time.
Don't bring me down, no no no no no,
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.

You wanna stay out with your fancy friends.
I'm tellin' you it's got to be the end,
Don't bring me down, no no no no no no no no,
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.

Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down.

What happened to the girl I used to know?
You let your mind out somewhere down the road,
Don't bring me down, no no no no no,
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.

You're always talkin' 'bout your crazy nights,
One of these days you're gonna get it right.
Don't bring me down, no no no no no,
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.

Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down.

You're lookin' good just like a snake in the grass,
One of these days you're gonna break your glass.
Don't bring me down, no no no no no no no no,
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.

You got me shakin' got me runnin' away
You got me crawlin' up to you everyday,
Don't bring me down, no no no no no,
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.

I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.

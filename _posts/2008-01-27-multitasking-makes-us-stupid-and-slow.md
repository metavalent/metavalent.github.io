A rare, but worthwhile  <a href="https://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/27/2221228&amp;from=rss">Slashdot</a> pass-through, here, to November 2007 Atlantic Monthly's <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200711/multitasking">The Autumn of the Multitaskers</a>, which begins:<blockquote>Neuroscience is confirming what we all suspect: Multitasking is dumbing us down and driving us crazy. One manâ€™s odyssey through the nightmare of infinite connectivity. -- Walter Kirn</blockquote>To my mind, this is interesting in the context of enhancing our brains. Should we play to our strengths and enhance THOSE, or branch out and make multi-tasking actually possible? In either case, why or why not?

"Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a powerful non-invasive tool widely used in both medical diagnosis and neurobiological research because it provides high temporal resolution in milliseconds which directly reflects the dynamics of the generating cell assemblies, and it is the only brain imaging modality that does not require the head/body to be fixed." -- <a href="http://sccn.ucsd.edu/~jung/bci.html">Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience</a>

Via <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/09/06/magic.mushrooms.ease.anxiety/index.html">CNN</a>:

<blockquote>Terminally ill cancer patients struggling with anxiety may get some <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/09/06/magic.mushrooms.ease.anxiety/index.html">relief from a guided "trip" on the hallucinogenic drug psilocybin</a>, a new study suggests. During the psilocybin sessions, which lasted six hours, the patients lay on a couch and listened to music through headphones.

By contrast [to placebo], one to three months after taking psilocybin the patients reported feeling less anxious and their overall mood had improved. By the six-month mark, the group's average score on a common scale used to measure depression had declined by 30 percent, according to the study, which was published in the Archives of General Psychiatry.

Notably, the psilocybin did not aggravate the patients' anxiety or provoke any other unwanted effects besides a slight increase in blood pressure and heart rate.</blockquote>

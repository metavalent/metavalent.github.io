The New York Times headline <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/college/coll02Uchitelle.html?ei=5070&amp;en=9029d49997026215&amp;ex=1129089600&amp;pagewanted=all">College Still Counts, Though Not as Much</a> is a bit misleading given that the  same article says: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2005/10/01/jobs/02uchitelle.graphic.html">College is Still Very Good for the Paycheck</a>.

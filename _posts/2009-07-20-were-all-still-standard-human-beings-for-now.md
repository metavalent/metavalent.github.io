However, this may not be the case for very much longer; hence the imperative to make some key policy and personal decisions, right now. What manner of individuals and society are we to become? As <a href="https://twitter.com/cascio" target="_blank">@cascio</a> writes, in <a href="https://tr.im/g3tsmart3r" target="_blank">The Atlantic Monthly</a>:<blockquote>if the next several decades are as bad as some of us fear they could be, we can respond, and survive, the way our species has done time and again: by getting smarter. But this time, we don’t have to rely solely on natural evolutionary processes to boost our intelligence. We can do it ourselves. The Nöocene awaits.</blockquote>

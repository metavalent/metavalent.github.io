<blockquote>I<span class="articletext">n a trustee court hearing on 24 April, the judge denied the request. She said that if she appointed a legal guardian for a chimp, then this might create the public perception that humans with court-appointed legal guardians are at the same level as animals.<br />

I'm sorry if this offends the human racists, but offense or lack thereof does nothing to alter reality.<br />

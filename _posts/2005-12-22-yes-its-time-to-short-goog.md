This is not news, rather, the latest evidence of Adsense turning a blind eye to (at best) or flat enabling (at worst) massive click fraud schemes.  Remember, you were warned here first.  Even Jim Cramer now says SELL GOOG in the upper 440's.  Read <a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/how_domain_name_typo_squatters_are_gaming_google/">How Domain Name Typo-Squatters are Gaming Google</a>, and place those short orders fast because this is just one of many issues that will soon come to light for the "Don't Be Evil" evil geniuses.  Hint: When somebody goes WAY out of their way to convince you how un-evil they are, guess what?

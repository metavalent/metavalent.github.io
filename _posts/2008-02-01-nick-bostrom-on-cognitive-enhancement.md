reminds me a bit of Malcolm Gladwell's "<a href="https://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/index.html">How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</a>." here, another highly encouraging 4 minutes and 57 seconds of typically incisive and motivational insights from the peerlessly motivational brain of dr. bostrom.
dig deeper into the topic of how "<a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7178/full/451520b.html">Drugs can be used to treat more than disease</a>" at nature.com.

remember, always give props to one's <a href="https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/2263/">sources</a>, especially when it includes the <a href="https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/2263/">reflections of dr. j</a>.

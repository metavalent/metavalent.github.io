Advances in artificial intelligence translate into ever-broadening functionality and autonomy. Recent years have seen an explosion in the use of robotics in warfare, medicine, and exploration. Industry analysts and UN statistics predict equally significant growth in the market for personal or service robotics over the next few years.

Three panelists with deep and varied expertise discuss the present, near future, and far future of robotics and the law.</blockquote><br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" alt="" src="https://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=229f729e-7ad1-8503-99f6-b2808042e99b" /></div>

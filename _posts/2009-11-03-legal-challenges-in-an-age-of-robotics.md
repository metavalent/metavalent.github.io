On Thursday, November 12, 2009, sponsored by The Rock Center for Corporate Governance and Stanford Program in Law, Science, and Technology, <a target="_blank" href="http://enews.law.stanford.edu/T/ViewEmail/r/DC81446E7BD29D47/9933B23CF9A27EFEC5EC08CADFFC107B">Legal Challenges in an Age of Robotics</a>:<br /><blockquote>Once relegated to factories and fiction, robots are rapidly entering the mainstream. Advances in artificial intelligence translate into ever-broadening functionality and autonomy. Recent years have seen an explosion in the use of robotics in warfare, medicine, and exploration. Industry analysts and UN statistics predict equally significant growth in the market for personal or service robotics over the next few years. What unique legal challenges will the widespread availability of sophisticated robots pose? Three panelists with deep and varied expertise discuss the present, near future, and far future of robotics and the law.</blockquote><br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" alt="" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=229f729e-7ad1-8503-99f6-b2808042e99b" /></div>

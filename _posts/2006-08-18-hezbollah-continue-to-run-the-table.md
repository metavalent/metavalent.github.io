Thomas P.M Barnett, points out that <a href="https://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/weblog/archives2/003594.html">Hezbollah continue to run the table</a>.
<blockquote>Hezbollah nails the war and now the peace. Do ya think Iran had preloaded its SysAdmin effort? (Take one Hezbollah and add money.)The real embarrassment here?

Our enemies are sizing our force structure through their victories and no one in DC seems to be paying any attention.

Get a clue, go symmetric.</blockquote>
Wow.  Mr. Barnett definitely seems to have one of the most unvarnished perspective of the Big Picture for American Christian-o-Imperialism that I've seen, to date.  He's pretty much dead-on in terms of defeating the latest conjured demon, Islamofascism.  C'mon ... Axis of Evil is so 90's, man.

In short, if you're going to be PERCEIVED AS an effectively benevolent Global Imperialist, you have to think like SysAdmin of The World and mostly keep Leviathan in the box.  SysAdmin and Leviathan are Barnett's terminology, by the way. I know, it sounds crazy, but then, it is WAR management we're talking about, here.  Related links of interest:

I'll link to the video archive of this C-SPAN2 8/18/2006 SESSION, as soon as it becomes available, here's the description:

"C-SPAN is hosting a special program with Thomas P.M. Barnett, author of the book "The Pentagon's New Map: Blueprint for Action, A Future Worth Creating." This work is a study of how globalization affects U.S. national security. It outlines a strategy for the way the U.S. and its military should operate in the post-September 11th world. The book is inspired by a briefing that Mr. Barnett has delivered hundreds of times in the past few years to government officials, military officers, business leaders and opinion makers. This show will aired a tape of Barnett giving that briefing, and from 9:30-10:30pm ET he took viewer phone calls. Thomas P.M. Barnett is a Senior Strategic Researcher at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and a former strategist in the Pentagon's Office of Force Transformation."

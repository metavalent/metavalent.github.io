As is so often the case, thanks to <a href="http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2007/05/dean-kamens-robotic-arm.html">Sentient Developments</a> for alerting me to this one. Yes, we're talking TACTILE fingertips, boys and girls. As I've ranted for years, we don't have to know what the cortex DOES to take advantage of its capabilities; all we need -- intially -- is clean, accurate, increasingly granular access to the I/O ports and we're in business. Yeah, yeah, yeah, to actually GET AT intelligence, we're going to have to understand <a href="http://metavalent.info/?p=570">invariant hierarchical sequential electro-chemical neuronal storage and auto-associative retrieval</a>; but in the meantime, there is no reason to not move forward with some of the lower level somato-sensory replacement parts and augmentations.

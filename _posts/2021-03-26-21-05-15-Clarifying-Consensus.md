It has come to our attention that there seems to be a tendency to confuse what we mean by the instantiation of new *default consensus realities.* Default Consensus Reality is simply a non-sectarian, non-denominational, expansive and inclusive secular bridge narrative toward a new heaven and a new earth.

The fundamental principles explored in this site do not constitute any kind of a proactive program. These are observations. Observations of the way that nature and the universe work, derived via the process of first-person lived experience, observing ever-changing conditions on this planet for the past 60+ years, and further analyzing through the microscopic and macroscopic (Micro-Macro) lenses provided by humanity's great wisdom, faith, scientific, and spiritual traditions. These observations have provided an overwhelming number of data points to observe and understand that *metavalent stigmergy* is the process by which people come to believe things in common, at scale, on a widespread basis.

### Authentic Consensus

To be angry about or *against* the process of metavalent stigmergy is like being angry about, or against mitosis, or gravity, or the words, "in the beginning." There is nothing to be angry about; to advocate for, or argue against. Cells divide, and that's how biological life transpires. Gravity keeps our bodies upon the surface of the Earth. "In the beginning," are the first three words of the most published book in history. I suppose we could argue about such things, but such arguments would indeed be a very rare and peculiar on this present planet Earth, because these three facts are immutable to virtually all sound human minds in the year 2021.

By definition, *authentic consensus* between fully informed conscious agents, cannot be coerced.

Default consensus reality is merely an observation. Have we repeated the word *observation* enough, yet?

### A Collective Default Mode Network

We observe that default consensus realities are a kind of default mode network of shared awareness of the world. Default consensus realities exist within families, within tribes, within villages, within cities, counties, states, nations, and ultimately the world.

We observe that default consensus realities (DCR's) tend to be largely unconscious, to most of any given population. DCR's are shared assumptions and presumptions about *how the world is*.

One current *default consensus reality* agrees that the sky is blue. Another prevalent default consensus reality is that we live in a world of conflict and strife. Both of those, appear to be empirically true, at the moment. Also, there are changes to the climate that could *literally change the color of the sky*. There are changes to the way we interact with one another in a society that literally could cultivate *conditions on Earth as it is in heaven*.

Those changes cultivate a new default consensus reality; not because anyone convinced anybody of anything; not because anybody forced anybody to do something differently; but because causes and conditions changed, and will continue to change, even in the context of the new default consensus reality.

### The Emptiness Of Conflict

That's it. That's all there is to this sense of *consensus*. Conflict simply does not exist in this space, unless a discordant brings it for pointless and absurd reasons of provoking disharmony. Even then, conflict is only misunderstanding. Hence, our responsibility is to attempt to increase and improve understanding whenever fleeting discordants disrupt the intrinsic tranquility of base reality in a vain attempt to feel immortal independent of that which is inherently immortal. Sounds crazy, I know. Will circle back one day to better explicate.

We've observed a curious phenomena in this life whereby others have lectured, berated, and at times physically, psychologically, or economically beaten us into submission to their world views while telling us that we were trying to do that to them. As a co-equal human being with you, dear reader, our observations are equally as valid as yours, right? I mean, if you're views are as valid as mine (as they obviously are), then that works both ways, or the principle free speech is fraudulent, right? So if *that* statement triggers you, we do suggest that it may be a personal problem that *you* might want to look into. Because, if you are angry at anything that you have read here, and feel that we must change our perceptions to match your perceptions, *that* would be you forcing something down our throats; not the other way around, right? It's just a definition, not even an opinion, right?

So, anyone who attempts to frame our work as trying to *shove something down somebody's throat* is either projecting or simply lying; most likely out of fear, or because they perceive they are losing some form of illegitimate power. Because, regardless of the language you use to refer to [this period of time and the changes underway](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2021/03/27/07-25-50-Spelunking-Equality.html), the dissolution of illegitimate power is rapidly accelerating, just as light rapidly dispels darkness. The sun rising in the morning is not an act of violence, it is a daily reminder of that which is.

As light shines forth in the darkness and the darkness cannot comprehend it, so it is in the hearts and minds of all sentient beings. For those with hearts to perceive, even the darkness is not darkness, for the nature of omnipresence is omnipresence. There is an energy that precedes even darkness and light, and there is an awareness that precedes even thought. We'll meet you there.

We have no program, yet may participate in many kinds of programs, in alliance and partnership. We are primarily observers of the changes underway. Nothing more, nothing less. Amituofo. Namaste. Aloha me ke Akua. Dios les bendigan. God bless the human race.

From the "if I had a penny for every time I've ranted on this topic" department: <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2008/02/08/a_google_horror.html">A True Google Living Nightmare</a>. <br /><br />A similar thing happened to me on Yahoo two years ago. A normal user would never have a chance in hell of recovering their account. Alas, perhaps there are occasional benefits to fully embracing the weirdness and huddling close with the deviantly inquisitive and productive crowd. After all, it's often such weirdos who actually create the breakthroughs, operate the complex data centers, stand guard over the critical BGP tables, batten down the root DNS servers, etc.  <br /><br />Still, if all this indistinguishable-from-magic grandeur isn't in service of The User, then what's the point, Program? "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084827/quotes">On the other side of the screen</a>, it all looks so easy."

#CurationValue is generated by the unique perspectives and lenses that an individual perceiver and experiencer brings to this emerging hybrid-human-ai global cognition space.

### Manufactured Attention Guidance Systems (MAGS)
Curation Value also provides a kind of _Manufactured Attention Guidance System_
for those learning to navigate this #PostAutomationEra exo-cortical #GlobalBrain terrain.

Yes, _like consent, attention can become manufactured_, at a lower cognitive abstraction layer. So, if we can the manufacture the attention of an individual, a group, a nation, a world, from the first waking moment of each day, consent becomes a given.

### What could possibly go wrong?

> What could possibly go wrong, right?

With this literal god-like power comes, of course, literal god-like responsibility. 

> Attention and consent can be cultivated for the benefit of individuals, groups, nations, and the world; with the dividends of curation value circulated among everyone such that every individual human basic needs is met; or, it can be cultivated for the extraction of value and aggregation of wealth among a relatively small and elite group of sadomasochistic humans who get off on both the conscience-extinguishing intoxication of their own putrid perversion of power, and the suffering inflicted upon others by the malordorous exercise of faux omnipotence.

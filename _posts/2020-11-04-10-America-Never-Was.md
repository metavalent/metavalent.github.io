The incomparable Langston Hughes - 1902-1967.

> Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed—
> Let it be that great strong land of love
> Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme
> That any man be crushed by one above.
> 
> (It never was America to me.)
> 
> O, let my land be a land where Liberty
> Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
> But opportunity is real, and life is free,
> Equality is in the air we breathe.
> 
> (There’s never been equality for me,
> Nor freedom in this “homeland of the free.”)

Media X and SRI International invite you to join us in a very special event on Tuesday, December 9, 2008 from 1:00 to 5:30 p.m. at Stanford University's Memorial Auditorium.

<strong>Engelbart and the Dawn of Interactive Computing: SRI's Revolutionary 1968 Demo - A 40th Anniversary Celebration</strong>

On December 9, 1968, Dr. Douglas C. Engelbart and the Augmentation Research Center at Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) staged a 90-minute public multimedia demonstration at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco. It was the world debut of personal and interactive computing: for the first time, the public saw a computer mouse, hypertext linking, real-time text editing, multiple windows, cathode display tubes, and shared-screen teleconferencing.

Join us to hear original participants recount what led up to the 1968 demo, the drama of the demonstration itself, and its impact which no one could have imagined at the time. Learn about Doug Engelbart's vision to use computing to augment society's collective intellect and ability to solve the complex issues of our time.

Speakers include Bob Sproull (Sun Microsystems); Daniel Borel (Logitech, Inc.); Chuck House (Media X at Stanford University); Paul Saffo (technology forecaster); 1968 demo participants Bill English (formerly SRI), Jeff Rulifson (Sun Microsystems), Don Andrews (formerly SRI), and 
Bill Paxton (University of California, Santa Barbara); Andy van Dam (Brown University); Christina Engelbart (The Doug Engelbart Institute); andAlan Kay (Viewpoints Research Institute).

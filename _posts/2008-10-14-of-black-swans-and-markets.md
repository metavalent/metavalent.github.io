<blockquote>Oct. 14 (Bloomberg) -- Investors advised by ``Black Swan'' author <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aDVgqxiT9RSg&amp;refer=home" target="_blank">Nassim Taleb</a> have gained 50 percent or more this year as his strategies for navigating big swings in share prices paid off amid the worst stock market in seven decades. 

``The Black Swan Protection Protocol is designed to break even 90 to 95 percent of the time,'' Spitznagel said. ``We happen to be in that other 5 to 10 percent environment.'' </blockquote>

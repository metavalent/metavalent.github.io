On a more uplifting note, <a href="http://sss.stanford.edu/">The Singularity Summit at Stanford</a> is coming on May 13th at MemAud.  If you haven't reserved a seat yet, <a href="http://sss.stanford.edu/rsvptoday/">do it now</a>, or risk being left behind with the rest of the meat puppets.  See?  Now wasn't that uplifting?

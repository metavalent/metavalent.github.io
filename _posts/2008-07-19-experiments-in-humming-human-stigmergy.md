Awesome fun from <a href="https://is.gd/XVY">Avant Games That Give a Damn</a>. My brain is exploding simply contemplating the multivariate experimental levels of interaction, cooperation, signaling, and I don't even know what else yet ... all taking place within the context of this alleged game. Something DANGEROUS is happening here, I don't know what it is yet, but it's AWESOME DANGEROUS ... dangerous to the status quo ... dangerous to any baseline context accepted as elemental to any modal interpretations of reality. 

Somehow, the Einstein quotation comes to mind, "The field is the sole governing agency of the particle." In this case, we have human particles traversing dynamically reconfiguring humming human feedback fields.

Jane is also a key co-conspirator in <a href="https://iftf.org/">Institute for the Future's</a> upcoming future forecasting game, <a href="https://is.gd/XtE">Superstruct</a>.

For some reason, this also reminds me somewhat of explorations in effecting environments beyond any direct conscious sensory feedback whatsoever, per "<a href="https://is.gd/XVX">Finding Balance: Addressing Cognitive Dissonances through Play</a>" (McKay, Niemeyer; 2006. <a href="https://is.gd/XVV">iTunes U</a>).

Alas, DATA is DATA and it's awfully hard to ignore empirical observations such as WTC 7's unprovoked collapse, the perfect symmetry of the towers dual collapse, and the presence of molten metal weeks after the event, bubbling at temperatures more typical of Thermate, far exceeding the heating capacity of jet fuel. What I <i>would</i> like to see is my own Direct Empirical Confirmation of some of these images and testimonies.
 
Certainly, it seems reasonable to suggest that a comprehensive <i>independent</i> commission investigation would go a long way toward either silencing the nutjobs for good or holding some of history's most notorious criminals accountable for their actions.

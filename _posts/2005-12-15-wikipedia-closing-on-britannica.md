Whatever is happening at Wikipedia is far too important to stifle with our tried and (not always) true methods.  If the traditional publishing industry forces this unlikely new creation back into its own old mold, it will be the extermination of a newly emerging literary species and a crime against Information's Nature of the highest order.  For all its flaws, Wikipedia is the most interesting manifestation of the wiki idea, in general.  There is yet far too much to learn from it to simply close it down because it make some feel uncomfortable.  There, I said it.

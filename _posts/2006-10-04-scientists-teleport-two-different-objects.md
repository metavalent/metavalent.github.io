CNN reporting <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/10/04/teleportation.reut/index.html">Scientists teleport two different objects</a>: "Professor Eugene Polzik and his team at the Niels Bohr Institute at Copenhagen University in Denmark have made a breakthrough by using both light and matter.

'It is one step further because for the first time it involves teleportation between light and matter, two different objects. One is the carrier of information and the other one is the storage medium,' Polzik explained in an interview on Wednesday."

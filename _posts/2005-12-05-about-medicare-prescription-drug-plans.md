I'm not a senior citizen just yet, but trying to make sense of <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/MPDPF/Shared/Static/Resources.asp#PlansCost"> the comparisons on Medicare.gov</a> is a real challenge.  How many 75 y.o.'s do YOU know that use the Internet on a regular basis, much less take the time to deal with the expansive web of information and comparisons of these new drug plans?  This link seems to indicate that the "basic" plan will cost senior's $3,600.00 out of pocket, each year.  Like I said, I'm not familiar with current expenditures, but that sure sounds like a pretty big chunk of change for folks on a fixed income.  If I were a cynic, I might suspect that the complexity is intentional, an indirect hard sell, intended to draw in the children of these seniors and the children's income.

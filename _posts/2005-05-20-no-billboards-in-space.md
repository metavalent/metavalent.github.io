The fact that this story is out there at all is evidence that <em>somebody</em> is awfully close to actually doing this.  The real space race is only now beginning to heat up.  Who has jurisdiction and by what right?  More fun than a barrel of space monkeys. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/space/05/20/space.advertising.reut/index.html">CNN.com - U.S.: No billboards in space</a>

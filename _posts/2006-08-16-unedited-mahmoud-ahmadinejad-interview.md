Still looking for a link to the actual video.  Generally, all content that airs on C-SPAN is available on its website shortly after airtime.  If you missed in in the media last week, here's a description of what I'm looking for at <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cbs/acting_on_request_of_iranian_prez_cspan_to_air_unedited_60_minutes_interview_41872.asp">TVNewser</a>.  As soon as I can find a link to the actual interview, I'll update this post.  Drop a comment if you can help out, thanks.

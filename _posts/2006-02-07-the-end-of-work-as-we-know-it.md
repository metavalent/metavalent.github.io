<!--Lead Photo --><a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/02/07/1837205"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://awebcamdarkly.com/">this actual skill set from a representative job solicitation</a> FAR exceeds the aptitude required to scrape old paint, hang wallpaper, or hammer nails, all of which pay significantly more than the posted example.  That is not to say that construction is worth *less* but rather that in an alleged meritocracy, the economic value of a job must by definition keep pace with the economic contributions of that job.  In a growing segment of the I.T. industry, that is just not happening.

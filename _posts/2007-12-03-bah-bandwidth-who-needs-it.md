What friggin' planet do these people live on? Nearly 2008 and in the earliest stages of the <a href="https://metavalent.info/?p=629">Race for Dominance of the Metaverse</a>, and yet *still* these morons are peddling <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7114642.stm">this pablum</a>?<blockquote>"We need significant evidence that such a [100Mbps broadband] network is required and I don't think it exists yet," said <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7114642.stm">Peter Philips</a>, Ofcom's head of strategy.</blockquote>Clearly, these people are  DANGER TO SOCIETY and should be replaced immediately or sooner:<blockquote>"We are not facing large numbers of people today who are constrained by their bandwidth," <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7114642.stm">Peter McCarthy-Ward</a>, BT</blockquote>Only a complete moron would ask something so retarded as:<blockquote>Will gaming be one of key drivers for increased bandwidth?</blockquote>Oh, I don't know, will THIRST be one of the key drivers for WATER DEMAND in the world?

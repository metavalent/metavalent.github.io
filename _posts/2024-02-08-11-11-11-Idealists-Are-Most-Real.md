### Frankl: "Now this void manifests itself as apathy, in boredom, lack of initiative," which are anti-reality.

Cynicism is not superior, it is the end of meaning, and the end of meaning is the end of a meaningful, worthwhile life. When we are in this state, we already know this, however deep the recursive layers of denial, addiction, and misdirection may run. It's only a matter of time until the the base case collapses the recursive loops of deception and the material world manifests reality as it was from the beginning, is now, and ever shall be. Psychotic delusions of superiority and *winning* are perhaps the most vicious drug, amplifying the toxic effects of all the others.

> ([3:05](https://youtu.be/OL8DyVusLeE?t=3m16s)) However it might be, whether the ones or the others are suffering more or less respectively from this existential vacuum, the ones who seem to suffer less should not look at the others with contempt but look at the others with compassion. And look for anything possible to help the others. Now this void manifests itself as apathy in boredom, lack of initiative, lack of interest - interest in the world or initiative in changing something within the world for the better. This frustration is a a proof of the existence of a will to meaning. &mdash; Viktor Frankl

"Information, in the form of energy, streams in, simultaneously, through all of our sensory systems, in the form of energy. And then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what it feels like, and what it sounds like. And in this moment we are perfect. We are whole and we are beautiful." - Jill Bolte Taylor [In any substrate.] -ms

"No longer at the mercy of the reptile brain, we can change our selves. Think, of the possibilities." - Carl Sagan

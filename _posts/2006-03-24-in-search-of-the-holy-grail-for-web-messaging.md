<div>There is a lot of innovation going on in the field of instant messaging and Ajaxy-Iframey sort of things. I'll fill in more detail a little later, but this is a pretty interesting little niche that is still under the radar. Once business gets a clue as to how useful it can be, I expect there are a few new millions to be made. Perhaps this time the right people will Pay Attention and we'll all make a few bucks.  Stay tuned for more.

Sorry, but I just don't think this kind of hyperbole helps the cause.<blockquote>It's an achievement that inspires notions of <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/science_robot_dc" target="_blank">robots with consciousness</a> and independent minds.</blockquote>Or this, where a potentially time-consuming computational process is anthropomorphized as dreaming. Absurd.<blockquote>Adami described how a robot like this one might perform in unknown territory, exploring the landscape and then "dreaming" of new methods to overcome obstacles it had encountered.</blockquote>

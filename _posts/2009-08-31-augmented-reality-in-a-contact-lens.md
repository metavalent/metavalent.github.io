<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/bionics/augmented-reality-in-a-contact-lens/0">IEEE Spectrum</a>: A new generation of contact lenses built with very small circuits and LEDs promises bionic eyesight
<blockquote>These visions (if I may) might seem far-fetched, but a contact lens with simple built-in electronics is already within reach; in fact, my students and I are already producing such devices in small numbers in my laboratory at the University of Washington, in Seattle [see sidebar, "A Twinkle in the Eye"]. These lenses don’t give us the vision of an eagle or the benefit of running subtitles on our surroundings yet. But we have built a lens with one LED, which we’ve powered wirelessly with RF. What we’ve done so far barely hints at what will soon be possible with this technology.</blockquote>

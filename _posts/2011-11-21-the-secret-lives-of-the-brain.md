<blockquote><p>"The conscious part is like a stowaway on a trans-atlantic steamship that is taking credit for the whole journey, without acknowledging the engineering underfoot. So, it's like when you have and idea and you say, 'oh, I just thought of something,' it wasn't <em>you</em> who thought of it, your brains been working on that for days or weeks, behind the scenes; churning things, consolidating information, trying things out; [pop!] finally it serves it up to you and you say, 'hey, I'm a genius!' But it wasn't <em>you</em> that thought of it, right?" -&nbsp;David Eagleman, neuroscientist and author of <a href="https://www.eagleman.com/incognito" target="_blank">Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain</a>.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:center;">

Oh, oh, now what, 19th century intellectual property status-quo defenders, "Protect IP Act," and SOPA? Neurobiology says you don't even get credit for what you thought was <em>your own</em> ideas! Nope! It's all Open Source, Creative Commons. Sorry about that.</p>

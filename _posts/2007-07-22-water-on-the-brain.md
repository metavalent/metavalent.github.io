This is of further interesting in the context of Jeff Hawkins observations about the role of the neocortex in intelligence. Even with the vast majority of his brain displaced by fluid, this outer blanket of brain enabled this man to function in a civil service job. Please go easy on the obvious career-path digs. :)

Also, this would seem to show us something about the relative insignificance of the shape of our gray goo in relation to personhood.

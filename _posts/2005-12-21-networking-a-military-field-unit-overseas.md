<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2005/121905nutter.html">We "inherited" a 1.2m satellite dish</a> that gives us 1024Kbps download speed and 512Kbps upload. The contention ratio is 10:1 with 29 private IP addresses. The satellite feed is plugged into a Linkstar ViaSat (TX Out &amp; RX In); there is one cable coming out of the 10/100 Base-T. I believe that is plugged into an 8-port Nway Switch manufactured by Encore Electronics."

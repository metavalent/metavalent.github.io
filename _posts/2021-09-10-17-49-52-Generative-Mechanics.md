Are these the clunky, crude, and basically dumb Pavlovian mechanics of generative Metavalent Stigmergy? Are these tools and techniques for engineering the very seeds of perceived realities?

If we are finally learning about such tools and techniques publicly, today, how long have they actually been deployed and in common use in military and other contexts?

### On the Upside

In terms of the potential for positive, self-directed, individual transformation, turns out the local narrator – from the quintessential infernal inner critic, incessant self-incriminating ambivalent asshole; the hard-driving drill sergeant, or uplifting internal coach and encourager – these are only a few of infinite possible internal narrators of our moment to moment experience.

Of course we do. How could it be any other way?

To what extent is this *essentially* the same teaching, if at all?

The scientific evidentiary burden of proof to call "*woo*" is now on you, dearest objecting objectivist friend. All you have to do is bring out the *Observer* and their Effect, describe The Observer's nature and characteristics by reproducible means, and easily reclaim the metavalence of a bygone 20th century weltanschaaung, right?

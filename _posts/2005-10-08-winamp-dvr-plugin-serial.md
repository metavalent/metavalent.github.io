Wow.  This is has got to be one of the most obscure reg codes I've ever succeeded in finding.  By using a combination of Google cache and Wayback, I finally found that the "serial" for installing the Winamp DVR Plugin is "BeCaptureWinamp2004."  From what can gather, it's not a serial at all, but a freeware installation password (huh?) that the software creators just haven't made very easy to find.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.

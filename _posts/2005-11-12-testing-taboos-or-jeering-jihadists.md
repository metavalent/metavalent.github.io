CSMonitor.com reporting <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/1110/p01s01-woeu.html?s=t5">Danish editor tests right to violate Muslim taboos</a>.  Interesting approach that, to my mind, could highlight the absurdity of the radical view to fence-sitters within Islam -- in the long run.  In the short run, don't be surprised to see the emergence of a Death To Cartoonists sub-faction of the Insane-o-slamic factions of Islam.

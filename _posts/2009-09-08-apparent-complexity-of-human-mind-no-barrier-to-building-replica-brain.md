Yesterday in <a href="https://www.physorg.com/news171565512.html">PhysOrg</a>, as referred by <a href="https://www.kurzweilai.net/news/news_single.html?id=11077">KAI</a>
<blockquote>A model that replicates the functions of the human brain is <a href="https://www.physorg.com/news171565512.html">feasible in 10 years</a> according to neuroscientist Professor Henry Markram of the Brain Mind Institute in Switzerland. â€˜I absolutely believe it is technically and biologically possible. The only uncertainty is financial. It is an extremely expensive project and not all is yet secured.'</blockquote>

Yesterday in <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news171565512.html">PhysOrg</a>, as referred by <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/news/news_single.html?id=11077">KAI</a>
<blockquote>A model that replicates the functions of the human brain is <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news171565512.html">feasible in 10 years</a> according to neuroscientist Professor Henry Markram of the Brain Mind Institute in Switzerland. ‘I absolutely believe it is technically and biologically possible. The only uncertainty is financial. It is an extremely expensive project and not all is yet secured.'</blockquote>

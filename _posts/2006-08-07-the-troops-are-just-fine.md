<!--Lead Photo --><a href="http://metavalent.info/images/sterile.handshake.jpg"><img src="http://img335.imageshack.us/img335/1304/200608012d03841250hcs7.jpg" loading="lazy" width="140" alt="0" align="left" border="0" /></a><!-- Commentary -->Can you believe that the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/">Weekly WhiteHouse.Gov newsletter</a> actually distributed <a href="http://metavalent.info/images/sterile.handshake.jpg">this photo</a>?  Why does the President need to sport aseptic protective gear to shake hands with a recuperating soldier?  If U.S. soldier aren't being exposed to anything  POTENTIALLY CONTAGIOUS, why the prophylactic garb there, Chief?  And since I worked in the operating room of a major research hospital in Texas for FIVE YEARS, make-believe stories about hospital protocol won't cut it.  Doctors DO NOT wear this stuff when making their rounds; this type of gear is reserved for asceptic environments like the O.R.  At best, it's utter incompetence that such a photo would be circulated by the P.R. monkeys, at all.

Hmmm ... no rubbers worn here ...

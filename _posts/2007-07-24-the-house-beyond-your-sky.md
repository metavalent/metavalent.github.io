<a href="https://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=5&amp;id=42314">SCI FI Wire</a> reports that veteran author Benjamin Rosenbaum has beat this would-be rookie to the punch. Congratulations, Ben. For my own sake (and others, I suspect), we can only hope that you've further opened a GENRE rather than zero-summed us out of contention for the posthuman prognostication market. Note to self: next time don't just listen to PJ, do what she says.  :)

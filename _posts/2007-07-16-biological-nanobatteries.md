The idea is to make use of the iron-containing protein <b>ferritin</b>, which apparently has the innate ability to carry either a positive or negative charge. In practice, one layer of ferritin would simply be stacked with another layer carrying the opposite charge, effectively forming a battery just a few nanometers thick</blockquote><br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="https://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p>

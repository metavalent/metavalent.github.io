At first glance, it looks like some great new improvements.  As quickly as I tend to critique the 3vi1 corporate GOOG beast; I still try to be as fair as my significant subjective biases allow.  

Just as with Microsoft and other beastly 3vi15 out there, many innocent and hardworking engineers are hard at work in the trenches and doing nice work.  So far, there does not appear to be a handy way to merge the old blogger sites like this one with <a href="https://metavalent.blogspot.com/">new gmail account-linked sites</a>, but it sounds like they'll be rolling this out in stages over the coming months.

If these improvements are anything close to what my first glimpse indicates, they could significantly ratchet up blogger's competitiveness as the self-publishing platform of choice.  One reminder, here.  Many people I've worked with seem to not understand that you do not HAVE to use blogspot.com with blogger.  You can absolutely use your own domain name, with no traces of anything but Your Own Brand.  This very site is proof of that, the only Blogger or Blogspot plugs are the ones that I placed there.

So if you already have a gmail account, or are just curious, check out <a href="https://buzz.blogger.com/2006/08/blogger-in-beta.html">the buzz</a>.

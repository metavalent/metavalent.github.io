It's far from the first time he's explained this perspective, but during today's <a href="http://www.terasemcentral.org/TL/2007ColloquiumProgram.html">3rd Annual Terasem Colloquium</a> on the Law of Transbeman Persons, the immortal Marvin Minsky reiterated the position that the term <i>consciousness</i> is really a cop-out. I was grateful to catch the last few hours of this event via phone-in conference call and equally grateful for the impressive transcription provided during Michael Anissimov's impressive <a href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/?p=618">live blogging performance</a>. Minsky's position, as logged by Anissimov:<blockquote>I don’t believe there is such a thing as consciousness. Consciousness is a high-level word we use as an abbreviation for about 20 types of mental activities: remembering what we have recently done, reflecting on whether what we’ve done is consistent with our moral model, etc. I believe humans have used “consciousness” for several centuries as an excuse for not thinking about what’s really going on.</blockquote>Irrepressibly engaging <a href="http://www.terasemweb.org/">Terasem</a> maven, <a href="http://www.cyberev.org/">CyBeRev</a>er, and <a href="http://www.lifenaut.com/">Lifenaut</a> Martine Rothblatt wrapped up the session by extending and further developing some of the implications of Minsky's view of consciousness and reiterating the now-familiar concept of transbemanism, juxtaposing that against the pros and cons of corporate personhood, and then proposing a new type of personhood test, derived from the current "real life test" required prior to gender change; as she put it, "Turing meets Freud meets Christine Jorgensen."

Be sure to catch <a href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/?p=618">the entire live blog entry</a> of this fascinating and productive session over at Accelerating Future. If I understand correctly, video and or audio may also be available, soon.

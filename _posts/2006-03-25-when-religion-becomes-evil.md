Unfortunately, <a href="https://atheism.about.com/b/a/190957.htm">this important work by Charles Kimball</a> will likely be avoided by the very people who needs its message most.  While Kimball was interviewed on BookTV in Dec 2005, for some reason I can't seem to locate the interview in the otherwise extensive and complete BookTV archives.  I did find this somewhat obtuse <a href="https://inside.c-spanarchives.org:8080/cspan/cspan.csp?command=dprogram&amp;record=547608988">reference to the program</a>, although no video is presently avaible there.  I've written to BookTV to enquire about the archived video and will definitely pass it on here when located.

Alas, yeah, and behold ... for it was between and beyond the Ringing In and Wringing Out of the GW Bush Beast, that ENCRYPTION did protect the least of the Earth from the soul-devouring jaws of the tyrant.  With its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster">flying spaghetti-inspired code</a> and <a href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-ipsec.html">tangled, noodly implementation</a> did ENCRYPTION deliver them, through and beyond this Thousand Years of Darkness that is, was, and always will be, today.

For as it is written, clueful people who take the time to make complex ideas increasingly accessible to an ever widening audience -- TEACHERS -- are among the most noble humans on the planet.  Such an one is brother reverend Steve Friedl, who's inspired epistle <a href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-ipsec.html">Illustrated Guide to IPsec</a> edifies, uplifts, and delivers a comprehensible accounting of IPSEC for the common seeker.  Having set up many an IPSEC network ourselves during these dark days, we have found this guide fearfully and wonderfully made; a well illustrated and clearly descriptive testament for those with an open heart and mind, ready to receive the Free Gift of Encryption for everyday, eternal life.

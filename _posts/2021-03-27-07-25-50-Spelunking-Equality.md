What is the nature of freedom, equality, in the context of Earth, 2021? If can, try consider these two videos, together, without prejudice or bias.

### An Age of Reconciliation

The reason for observing the two videos above is to provide a context for understanding conditions as they presently exist on planet Earth. These are not my opinions, these are examples of people taking action in the world, each from their individually-guided sense of internal truth, justice, and liberty for all. Isn't this what we purport to believe in, in the present *[default consensus reality](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2021/03/26/21-05-15-Clearing-Confusion.html)*?

From this perspective, we have also seen some surprising confusion over the phrase *equality of outcome*. Universal [social security](https://Chaotic immunity.com/) is emphatically and empirically **not** equality of outcome; yet is somehow occasionally misperceived and depicted as such by those who benefit from the present State of Affairs. We observe that there exists an extremely misanthropic view of humanity. A view of humanity that considers the species as incapable of growing beyond our basest, most animalistic aspects of our complex and multi-dimensional nature. Perhaps those observations are correct, and we are overly optimistic. However, our own direct observations lead us to the following.

### Engineered Economic Precarity

Engineered economic precarity has served the ruling class of America well, for over a quarter of a millennium.

Engineered economic procurity has resulted in suicide becoming the second leading cause of death for people between the ages of 21 and 45, as of 2020.

Engineered economic precarity resulted in the vulnerability that made the United States the single most afflicted nation, in the case of a pandemic. And rest assured, a worse pandemic will come, one day. Perhaps in a year, perhaps in a decade, perhaps during our children's lifetime. It *will* happen, because pandemics have *always* happened on planet Earth, and will always happen from time to time. It's simply the fact of the matter. It's also the fact of the matter that each generation is born ignorant of the previous generations, and it is not always simple to transfer knowledge in a way that is understood, respected as authentic, and therefore taken seriously.

The hucksterism and commodification of literally everything, in order to sell, sell, sell, has exacerbated the distrust between generational knowledge transfer. This does not bode well for a species that is so highly dependent upon intergenerational knowledge transfer for its survival.

### The Ending Of An Era

Bankers and money changers who co-opted Christianity to provide sheep's clothing for the capitalist wolves of Wall Street have long been handsomely rewarded; flying in their private jumbo jets and pontificating from their golden pulpits and crystal cathedrals. This era has come to an end. We cannot serve God and Mammon, and it will be a good exercise for anyone who does not understand that saying to investigate it for yourselves. We are not here to convince, we are here to observe, and to share our observations.

Some people are referring to this time as The Great Reset, some people are referring to this time as the true dawning of the Age of Aquarius, some people are referring to this as a time of genuine spiritual Reformation and Revival, some people are describing this as an energetic phase shift, from the 3D to the 5D.

We have dubbed all of these, and more, as features of the #PostAutomationEra. This is the era in which human creativity and ingenuity has automated so much of the creation of our individual and collective material needs, that we are literally in a new era of civilization. We have not seen a phase shift like this in our societal configuration since the dawning of the Industrial Era. It's disruptive. It's scary for many people. It comes with many blessings and curses, which we ought to look upon with opened eyes, grateful hearts, and responsible minds; responsibile for the care of this planet and it's raw natural resources; water, air, soil; without which, none of this paradise exists.

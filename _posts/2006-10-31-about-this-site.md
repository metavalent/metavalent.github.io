in <strong>First Life</strong>, a playful if oft pointless posthumanish portal of parturient postulations perhaps approaching an eventual emergent focus.

in a <strong>Second Life</strong> haven, posing as a self-deprecating vainglorious role-playing maven; exploring and debunking an experimental proto-identity as harbinger of all things metavalent; observering, absorbing, reframing, reporting as Metavalent Harbinger.

in <strong>Third Life</strong> (see '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Place">Third Place</a>' for analogical context) like <a href="https://metavalent.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a>, <a href="https://metavalent.newsvine.com/">Newsvine</a>, and more recently <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=511240169">Facebook</a>; an experimental extension of the First and Second, toward a practical, participatory, <em>Accountable Anonymity</em>.

prior to being <a target="_blank" href="https://the-aesthete.blogspot.com/2005/10/pulsate-like-former-heart.html">jory'd</a> (also see, <a href="https://wikidashboard.parc.com/wiki/Ubik">ubik</a>) by some kind of  metavalent <a target="_blank" href="https://wikidashboard.parc.com/wiki/Stigmergy">stigmergy</a>,  the original idea for this site, aWebcamDarkly, had devolved into little more than a compost heap for all kinds of interweb refuse that seemed --  albeit, by a willfully if whimsical narcissistic disshelveled irrational intuition -- of vastly greater overstated significance to our world and its  future than is presently conceivable by today's extant 44+2 hominid variety.  and yet, i must resist the urge to coddle, dear reader.   only following the links, digesting the material, can make all discernable over time.  glossing, glancing, or  assuming that previously demonstrated powers of pattern recognition will be, or should be good enough -- are not.  and so it  gradually dawned upon me that any attempt to describe the aforementioned meaning, or comment upon it in any detail, would only  detract from the imperative and consciously inconsequential collecting and composting process.  what this means is, things didn't turn out  <a href="https://metavalent.info/?p=3">as planned</a> and that clicking through  the pages of what is now called metavalent.info (until <a href="https://metavalent.info/?page_id=499#dotcominance">such time</a> as the camper holding out on metavalent.com lets go) is like rummaging through the  <a href="https://wikidashboard.parc.com/wiki/VALIS">Valis</a> office trash bins, picking out and uncrumpling  scraps and drafts of scribbled or sketched intentions in a vain attempt to discern the meaning of  the scrap's creator.  metavalent.info is then, in its current form, an essentially misanthropic and pretty much pointless proliferation of highly abridged and largely neglected semi-articulations of what one might  otherwise consider something of a mandelbrot-like maelstrom of mostly incomplete intuitions, formed as the ignoble result of information gluttony and attendant, inevitable bloat of intellectual indigestion. here they huddle, such and sundry displaced, disadvantage, and disjointed imaginings, under what might only  be described as a rickety handcrafted mud and grass hut of a web space; starving for attention, agape  with pity-provoking, bleary, teary, and utterly innocent wide-eyed little barefoot orphaned aspirations.So hurry and ...</p>

<p>... or risk dying of eternal guilt and shame not not even sparing so much as a miserly click or two. Or worse yet, run the risk of becoming an everlasting inculpatory extropian.  Hey, it's your beman karma, friend, I'm just trying to help. Besides, it's all psychobabble rap to me.</p>

Alternatively, if you are a sysadmin type or like low-cost hosting with a minimum of hand-holding (yet super clueful staff on board for when you screw up and break things) then you might like Dreamhost. If you are satisfied with the "good enough" performance of this site (to hell with the content), then like the ad says, "don't be an idiot" and click away. Can't hurt you in the least and it will help us keep the lights on.

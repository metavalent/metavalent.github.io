<b>Mirus, Linspire and AOpen Introduce $399 Mini Linux PC</b>

'Mini Koobox' Linux Desktop Comes Pre-Installed With Full Office Suite and Multimedia Software

SAN DIEGO, June 28 /PRNewswire/ -- Linspire, Inc., developers of the leading consumer desktop Linux operating system, along with AOpen and Mirus Innovations, today announced the availability of the Linspire Mini Koobox, the first small form-factor Linux machine on the market. Starting at just $399 after $100 mail-in rebate, the Mini Koobox is based on an Intel platform built by AOpen and comes with the easy-to-use Linspire Linux operating system, which includes full Microsoft file-compatible office suite, DVD player and DVD-playing software, music and photo management software, Internet applications, e-mail and instant messaging capabilities. The Linspire Mini Koobox is now being sold online through Mirus Innovations as part of its Koobox line of desktop computers. For more information about the Mini Koobox, visit www.koobox.com.

"As the prices of desktop computers continues to drop, consumers are starting to bring multiple computers into their homes," said Kevin Carmony, president and CEO of Linspire, Inc. "However, low cost isn't the only consideration. As you add more computers to more rooms, space and aesthetics also start to become factors. Buying a low-priced Linux machine usually means you'll have to sacrifice on style and select from a limited supply. We developed the Mini Koobox with Mirus and AOpen because we know there is high consumer demand for ultra-compact home computers that not only look great and perform well, but also don't cost a fortune."

Measuring in at just 6.5 x 6.5 x 2 inches and 3.0 lbs., the basic configuration boasts a brushed matte-platinum case with clear blue plastic accents, slot-in slim CDRW/DVD combo drive with DVD-playing software, integrated Ethernet card, and is based on the Intel 915 chipset. To add to the streamlined aesthetic, ports are located in the back of the unit, including two USB 2.0 ports, one IEEE 1394 port (Firewire), speaker-out, S-video, and mic. The Mini Koobox also has a DVI monitor connector and includes a DVI-to-VGA adapter so that it can be connected to plasma-display or large-format monitors. Inside, the machine checks in with 256 MB DDR2 RAM, Intel Celeron M 370 1.5 Ghz processor, and a 40 GB hard drive.

Upgraded versions of the Mini Koobox are also available, including a version priced $499 after mail-in rebate with Intel Celeron M 370 processor, 512 MB RAM, 60 GB hard drive, and a CDRW/DVD combo drive. For $50 more, a third model priced at $549 after mail-in rebate includes an Intel Pentium M 725 1.6 Ghz processor. All Mini Koobox units come with a 15-day free subscription to Linspire's CNR software download service, plus keyboard, mouse and speakers. These Koobox models are aggressively priced, considering the Mac Mini starts at $599 for a basic configuration that does not include a keyboard, mouse, or speakers. Complete system specifications and a comparison chart on Mini Koobox options are available at www.koobox.com.

The Mini Koobox features the stable and secure Linux-based operating system from Linspire, which comes complete with major desktop applications, including OpenOffice.org (a Microsoft file-compatible office suite); Web browser, e-mail and instant messaging clients; multimedia viewers; photo and music managers; calendaring tools; and more. Access to additional software and applications is available through Linspire's innovative CNR ("click and run") Warehouse, a software library where users can download and install thousands of Linux and open source programs. For more information about Linspire, visit www.linspire.com.

"Right out of the box, you can use the Mini Koobox to do everything you've been doing on your existing Windows machine -- without buying extra software," Carmony added. "Average home computer users don't need to spend thousands on a fancy computer just to browse the Internet, send email, share photos or do basic office functions. The Mini Koobox is the perfect second, third or fourth computer for your home, apartment or dorm."

In addition, consumers who are interested in switching to Linspire Linux from a Windows system can take advantage of several tools to make the transition, including software such as Win4Lin and Crossover Office, which allow key Windows software to run under Linspire Linux, and a desktop migration tool called Versora that allows easy transfer of files, bookmarks, and programs from Windows to Linspire. Win4Lin, Crossover Office and Versora are all available for Linspire users through the CNR Warehouse (www.linspire.com/cnr).

The Linspire Mini Koobox, like other Koobox computers sold by Mirus, includes a 90-day warranty, but for only $29 consumers can purchase an optional premium warranty with toll-free support and replacement parts. Other expanded warranty options are available as well, including on-site technical support. For warranty details, see www.koobox.com.

Koobox computers are built by AOpen, manufactured and shipped directly by Mirus, fully certified by Linspire and tested by quality of standards that are ISO 9001 certified and 100 percent compliant with industry standards.

This is a picture of just some of the more than 25,000 Americans under attack by Israel.  Yet, the White House never uttered a word of caution to "slow down and DO NOT PUT AMERICANS AT RISK."  In a word: unconscionable.  If this administration is not doggedly protective of 25,000 American Citizens living in Lebanon, what makes us think they were doggedly protective of those in the World Trade Towers.  To date, I've generally considered <a href="https://www.infowars.com/">9/11 conspiracy theorists</a> like Alex Jones a bit nutty and <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html">thoroughly debunked</a>.  Even the findings of the rational sounding <a href="https://st911.org/">9/11 Scholars For Truth</a> seemed quite a stretch.  But events like this -- allowing Israel to bomb heavily American-populated areas without so much as a "whoaaa, slow down there, par'dner ..." certainly don't harm the otherwise irrational, paranoid, wild-eyed conspiracy case.

Perhaps <a href="https://www.c-span.org/watch/index.asp?Cat=TV&amp;Code=CS&amp;ShowVidDays=30&amp;ShowVidDesc=&amp;ArchiveDays=30">C-SPAN</a> and <a href="https://www.booktv.org/watch/">BookTV</a> coverage this weekend <strong>          July 29 - 31 </strong>is worth watching, after all.  Even if you don't have cable, if you can read this, you can watch or listen online using the links in the previous sentence.

<a href="https://www.circleid.com/posts/splitting_the_root_its_too_late/"><img src="https://www.circleid.com/images/logo.gif" border="0" /></a>Wow, John Levine has it right on when he says, "Now that the split root genie is out of the bottle, is there any way to get it back in? Not that I can see. Let's hope that users in China and other countries with their own private roots figure out that there's more to the net than their DNS shows them."

Unfortunately, hoping for this is not going to trump reality.  This is a much bigger problem than most could possibly imagine.  What this means is, in essence, "The Internet" is dead ... there is no longer a noun-form Internet; instead, there are now a splintering set of continental internets that will only fragment further from here.  

Wakeup and smell the Internet != Global Market.

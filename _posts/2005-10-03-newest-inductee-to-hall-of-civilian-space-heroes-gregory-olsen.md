As the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition12/exp12_launch.html">Expedition 12 Crew Arrive at ISS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Olsen">Greg Olsen</a> entered the Hall of Heros for civilian space flight, joining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth">Mark Shuttleworth</a> and Civilian Astronaut #1 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Tito">Dennis Tito</a> as the first humans to put their money where their mouths are -- FOR ALL OF US!

It is only due to the bravery of these tremendous pioneers that the rest of us planetbound proletariat can look forward to chillin' in space as a viable alternative to cruising the Carribean. Unlike Orville and Wilbur, the odds of these great men being immortalized in elementary school text books are probably minute, so we thank the Cosmos for organizations like Wikipedia and Archive.Org for helping us to never forget.

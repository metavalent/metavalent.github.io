Just on the heels of listening to the Audible.com rendition of Jeffrey Hawkins's "<a href="https://metavalent.info/?p=570">On Intelligence</a>," it seems only befitting to discover the January 2000 treatise, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/">The Identity Theory of Mind</a> (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) has been upgraded within the past ten days:<blockquote>The identity theory of mind holds that states and processes of the mind are identical to states and processes of the brain ... to the effect that these experiences just <em>are</em> brain processes, not merely<em> correlated with</em> brain processes (J. J. C. Smart).</blockquote>Much of Hawkins's thesis revolves around similar ideas, and he goes to great lengths to describe a plausible framework for exactly HOW the mind emerges from two very simple fundamental operations: storage and prediction. Hawkins theorizes that through auto-associative, invariant, hierarchical interactions of stored sequences of patterns (brain states), we become conscious, self-aware. To this layman, it is a highly fascinating and pragmatic contribution.<br />

Yes, there is much more to it, and Hawkins concedes that many strictly utilitarian neuroanatomists could well take him to task on any number of specifics; however, suffice to say that Hawkins seems to have perfectly prepped the reader (or listener in this case) to consider JJC Smart's work -- the subject of this entry -- over the coming week.<br />

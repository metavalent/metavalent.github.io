"Even though I'm 94, I still have ambitions," Estelle Strongin, a 94-year old financial advisor still works every day.

And why should that surprise any thinking human being?

Estelle was asked, "What makes it harder for you, being your age?"

Her honest and sociologically revolting response, "<strong>People's attitude about older people</strong>. People are a little skeptical about your ability. At dinner parties or at cocktail parties or at gatherings, young people are always very courteous, and for some reason think they have to kiss you on the cheek, but they're very anxious to go on to the next person."

This KQED production brings a California perspective to the national Frontline episode. Featuring local experts on geriatric care, the program will examine what California can expect in the decades to come, and gives families specific advice on how to choose the care that best suits the needs of an elderly relative or friend. It also examines a trailblazing program citizens in Palo Alto are implementing to deal with their own retirements.

For the first time in American history, "the old old" -- those over 85 -- are now the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. Medical advances have enabled an unprecedented number of Americans to live longer, healthier lives. But for millions of elderly, living longer can also mean a debilitating physical decline that often requires an immense amount of care. And just as more care is needed, fewer caregivers are available to provide it. In "Living Old," FRONTLINE investigates this national crisis and explores the new realities of aging in America. A powerful and intimate journey into the uncharted territory of Americans living longer than ever -- and what it means for them, their loved ones and our society. <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/livingold/view/" target="_blank">Watch</a> full program online.

If you haven't already found them elsewhere, you definitely do not want to miss the <a href="https://www.agi-08.org/conference/">videos from AGI-08</a>, the seminal AGI event of our time. Of course, no sooner did the inaugural conference end than the next steps of the journey begin:<blockquote>Continuing the mission of the highly successful first AGI conference (AGI-08) that was held at the University of Memphis in March 2008, <a href="https://www.agi-09.org/">AGI-09</a> will gather an international group of leading academic and industry researchers involved in serious scientific and engineering work aimed directly toward the goal of artificial general intelligence.

This is the only major <a href="https://www.agi-09.org/">conference series</a> devoted wholly and specifically to the creation of AI systems possessing general intelligence at the human level and ultimately beyond.</blockquote>

The ideas in <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/extropians.html">Wired Issue 2.10, October 1994</a> have seemed more or less intuitively obvious to me for several decades, but I always struggled for a way to articulate the vision.  Thanks to Max More and Tom Morrow, a growing band of biobeyonders have come together and continued to refine these ideas, flesh out the challenges, and contemplate the alternatives that contempory technology offers.  History has shown, time and again, that technology for it's own sake often leads to disasterous unintended consequences, so the importance of rigorous evaluation of the course ahead of us can't be overstated.<ul><li></li><a href="http://www.extropy.org/">Extropy Institute</a>

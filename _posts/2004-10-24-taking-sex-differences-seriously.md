<a href="https://tinyurl.com/5xad5">Steven Rhoads gave a talk</a> on his new book at the Heritage Foundation on August 10, 2004. If you ever wondered why the American family has hit such a slick spot in recent decades, with relationships spinning off the road and into the ditch in record numbers, this is a must see video stream.  You can safely advance your video viewer to the 5 minute marker where the talk actually begins.

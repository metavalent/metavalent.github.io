> > Brain-cell regeneration has been found in a new location in our brains – the new cells may one day be used to treat brain diseases or help stroke
> 
> The procedure they used to find these regenerative neuron pools is clever.

> “To reveal the new brain cells, the team exploited the fact that there have been varying levels of a radioactive isotope of carbon – carbon-14 – in the atmosphere since nuclear bomb tests during the cold war. This means that the year of creation of [many cells in the body can be found by measuring the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in its DNA](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23665-nuclear-bomb-tests-reveal-brain-regeneration-in-humans.html). Analysis of 30 donated brains revealed which brain cells had been born during the lifetimes of the donors.”

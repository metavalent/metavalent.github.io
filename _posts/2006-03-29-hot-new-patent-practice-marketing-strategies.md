So, apparently <a href="http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/communications/0,39044192,39346317,00.htm">marketing and advertising strategies are now patentable inventions</a>. It is flat embarrassing that USPTO would engage in such chintzy chicanery. <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> has been resizing browser displays based on the devices used for YEARS; but toss in some ads and it's a whole new <b>invention</b>? I don't think so.  USPTO and GOOG hooking up is like a Bill Clinton and Britney Spears affair; the crusty old beauracrat and debutante turned cow-queen.  He gets to pretend he's young, she gets to pretend she's important.  Brilliant.

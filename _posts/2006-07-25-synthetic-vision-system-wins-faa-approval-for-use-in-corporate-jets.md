"[T]his week, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17196">Gulfstream became the first executive plane maker to offer the [synthetic vision] system</a>, which displays a computer-generated view of the terrain ahead -- even in heavy fog or cloud, when the ground can be invisible to the most advanced infra-red sensors.  [The] SVS will result in more accurate tactical flight decisions by pilots and ultimately increased safety."

I have to admit that I'm a little surprised that a publication as hip as MIT-TR fails to mention that this system is the product of the <a href="https://www.ffc.arc.nasa.gov/">NASA Simlabs at Future Flight Central</a>.  I've been privileged to tour the NASA Future Flight labs and get acquainted with a few of the engineers over there, and it's a truly impressive facility and certainly the engineering staff are all rock stars, kings, queens, visionaries and prophets in the Book of Metavalence.  Who the hell cares what Paris Hilton is wearing?  The NEWS is created by the cerebral celebrities at labs like this, and others all across the nation and around the world.

Apparently, Comcast will not allow you to protect your own information on their network.  I've spent about 20 minutes eliminating all the most common explanations and will do a little more testing, but this is what happens when I try to access my Comcast home page using Anonymizer.  I give it a 95% chance that I won't find anything other than Comcast blocking anonymized traffic.  More later.

<a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/multimedia/2009/04/gallery_rabbit_eye">Coders and neuroscientists have teamed up</a> to make a 20-terabyte map of every cell in the back of a rabbit's eye. By comparing healthy samples with pictures of damaged retinas, these researchers can make sense of the diseases that cause blindness, and perhaps find ways to repair injured eyes.

The long anticipated <a href="https://www.thetech.org/bodyworld/">Body World2 and The Three Pound Gem</a> opened today at the TheTech Musuem of Innovation in San Jose. Can't wait to check it out! From the site:<blockquote>Body Worlds 2 &amp; The Three Pound Gem presents the complexity and beauty of the human body, preserved through Plastination, the groundbreaking method of specimen preservation invented by anatomist, Dr. Gunther von Hagens. More than 200 authentic human specimens offer visitors profound insights into the form and funciton of the human body, wellness and disease, and the [increasingly less] mysterious world of the brain.</blockquote>Sorry, couldn't resist that one small interlinear editorial comment. :-) Personally, I'd like to see the <a href="https://www.thetech.org/exhibits/online/robotics/ethics/index.html">Machine and Man: Ethics and Robotics in the 21st Century</a> section of TheTech significantly expanded, as well.

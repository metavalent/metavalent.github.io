### What's Atomically Precise Bottom-up Fabrication Got To Do With It, Got To Do With It?

[On-Surface Synthesis of Edge-Extended Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adma.202306311) are a refinement of [Atomically precise bottom-up fabrication of graphene nanoribbons](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09211). Probably nothing. 

#### ChatGPT's summary:

Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are narrow strips of graphene, usually with widths less than 50 nanometers. Due to their unique structure and properties, GNRs have found potential applications in various fields. Some of the most notable applications include:

1. **Electronics**:
    - GNRs are seen as potential components in next-generation electronic devices due to their exceptional electrical conductivity and small dimensions.
    - They can be used in field-effect transistors (FETs) which are crucial for many electronic devices. GNRs can potentially enable the production of smaller and faster transistors compared to traditional silicon-based transistors.

2. **Photonics and Optoelectronics**:
    - The bandgap of GNRs can be tuned by altering their width and edge structure, making them suitable for photonic and optoelectronic applications such as photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, and lasers.

3. **Energy Storage and Conversion**:
    - Due to their high surface area and excellent electrical conductivity, GNRs are explored for use in batteries, capacitors, and fuel cells to improve energy storage and conversion efficiencies.

4. **Sensors**:
    - GNRs can be used in gas and biosensors due to their high surface area, which provides ample reactive sites, and their sensitivity to changes in their surroundings.

5. **Nanocomposites**:
    - They can be incorporated into composite materials to enhance their mechanical, electrical, or thermal properties.

6. **Biomedical Applications**:
    - GNRs have potential applications in drug delivery, bioimaging, and tissue engineering due to their biocompatibility and ability to be functionalized with various biomolecules.

7. **Thermal Management**:
    - Graphene nanoribbons can be used in thermal management solutions due to their outstanding thermal conductivity.

The exploration of graphene nanoribbons is still in a relatively nascent stage with ongoing research aimed at uncovering new applications and overcoming challenges associated with their synthesis and integration into existing technologies.

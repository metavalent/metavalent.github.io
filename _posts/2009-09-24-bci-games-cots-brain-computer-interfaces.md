Remember when you thought that Flight Simulator, complete with joystick, was "just a toy?" Turns out, actually, we were <a href="http://wikidashboard.parc.com/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle">training UAV jockeys</a>, right?

So sure, <a href="http://www.neurosky.com/">these first BCI commercial devices</a> may seem primitive. Then, so was the Apple II, right? The important thing here is that we are now actively enabling, encouraging, and training up young brains of all ages to Think About What It Might Mean to have truly robust and responsive BCI. STS has long explained that technology is seldom the proximate barrier to sociotechnological advance; rather, geographical and cultural factors, and plain old human behavioral inertia slows diffusion and uptake of technologies. 

As we move forward into the early stages of the BCI Revolution, entirely new areas of psychological adaptation will emerge, and become better illumined, as well. To my mind, this is where the real interesting research lies, but more on that later. For now, you'll have to settle for polishing up your pyrokinetic powers using an entirely new kind of Mindset:

Uniform Standard for Aligning Shareholder and Stakeholder Interests for the Twenty-First Century American Economic Acceleration Act

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

[date]

Mr./Ms. [Representative’s name] introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on [Committee]

A BILL

To amend Title 29, United States Code, Section 1104, relating to Fiduciary Duties, to incorporate a comprehensive standard of care that considers the interests of all stakeholders.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the “Twenty-First Century American Economic Acceleration Act.”

SECTION 2. COMPREHENSIVE STANDARD OF CARE.

(a) Section 1104 of Title 29, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:

“(a) Comprehensive Standard of Care

(1) Subject to sections 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and 1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge their duties with respect to a plan considering the interests of all stakeholders, including but not limited to shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, community, environment, and

(A) for the purpose of:

(i) providing benefits to shareholders, participants, and their beneficiaries;

(ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan;

(B) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims, while considering the interests of all stakeholders;

(C) by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses and to consider the impact on all stakeholders, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so; and

(D) in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III.”

SECTION 3. PURPOSE.

This revised version of the 29 U.S. Code § 1104 - Fiduciary Duties and Standards aims to protect Directors of all Corporations from adverse legal consequences when considering and prioritizing values in addition to shareholder benefit. It acknowledges the historic prevalence of shareholder primacy while aligning with and integrating stakeholder theory, thus allowing free capital markets to express and implement the full range of their independently chosen values, freed from historical constraints of strict primacy, through investing in any corporate entity of their choice, in accordance with U.S. Code, and consistent with the practice and principles of free enterprise.

Footnotes
“BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s highly regarded annual letter to CEOs (2022) highlights stakeholder corporate governance: ‘In today’s globally interconnected world, a company must create value for and be valued by its full range of stakeholders in order to deliver long-term value for its shareholders. It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long-term.” Fink also calls attention to the importance of centering corporate purpose in this context, stating, “Putting your company’s purpose at the foundation of your relationships with your stakeholders is critical to long-term success.’”2 ↩

This also mirrors [Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance] long-held opinion regarding the purpose of the corporation, which can be summarized as follows: The purpose of a corporation is to conduct a lawful, ethical, profitable and sustainable business in order to enable its success and increase in value over the long term. This requires consideration of all the stakeholders who are critical to its success (shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and communities) as determined by the corporation and its board of directors using their business judgment and with regular engagement with its shareholders, who are essential partners in supporting the corporation’s pursuit of its purpose. Fulfilling this purpose in this manner is fully consistent with the fiduciary duties of the board of directors, and the concomitant stewardship obligations of shareholders. ↩

### Legendary But-Then-I-Got-High "Clerks" Director Kevin Smith Quits Weed?! What is this world coming to?

Silent Bob returns to his right mind with epic grace and style.

Video below, but first a word from our sponsor. *Trauma Is Trauma* and Kevin does an incredibly transparent job of explaining how trauma's toxic transitive bonds are as pernicious as they are prevalent in the light of the early dawn of this Post-Automation Era.

It's a bad news day in wonderland, Alice. You're not going to like what you read here.

All too often when people open up about such difficulties, the response is along the lines of:

> "That's *all* you went through? That's *all* she said or did? I went through so much worse, wait till you hear ..."

Like some kind of toxic trauma Olympics, one-upping who's suffered more and who's endured more and therefore who is *stronger* and deserving of more sympathy supply. Well summed up in the infamous "I have no empathy" meme.

<!--
... and who therefore takes on the self-appointed *burden* and responsibility to judging and micro-managing the behavior of everyone on the island. Who should stay and who should go. Woe is me with my infinite burden of such *kindness* to dispense throughout the community, to bless those who obey and comply and curse those who dare oppose my merciless *kindness*. 
-->

And if that wasn't bad enough, you're really not going to like this.

The emaciated soul of a toxic culture engaged in this bizarre kind of passive aggressive Trauma Games; minimizing, dismissing, competing over who has had it worse, or how much *you need to toughen up* and grow a thick skin so you can *take a joke*, half-formed adolescent brains instilled with and haunted by body dysmorphia, massively pressured into deciding *who they are* before their brain is even half developed, to the point of children slicing and dicing their own bodies, up to and including suicide as a leading cause of death; in fact, **nearly twice as many suicides as homicides**. No, it ain't pretty.

Would it be ridiculous to remind that the center of such a denial-addicted self-inflicted-wounded fantasy society cannot hold, and that it already exhibits many signs of a quantum quiet quitting self-implosion well underway?

[According to the CDC](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide) Americans are twice as much at risk of harm *to* ourselves and *toward ourselves*, than from others, as we hunker down in shifty-shady exclusive gated communities.

> Suicide was the second leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10-14 and 25-34 , the third leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 15-24, and the fourth leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 35 and 44.

> There were nearly two times as many suicides (45,979) in the United States as there were homicides (24,576).

Kevin goes on:

> "Weed is wonderful because unlike alcohol or some other substances, in my job, in my world, I can be high as a kite and still do everything I need to do, in fact probably do more than I could if I wasn't numb. Because when I'm not numb, I have to be alone with my own thoughts, which are some of the most terrifying places to be. Alone with our own thoughts."

> "I had a wound that marijuana was really good for, and I had this open wound and I put a bandaid on it, that's what weed was. But the one kept getting bigger and bigger and so I put more Band-Aids on it, and more Band-Aids on it. By the time I walked into Sierra Tuscon I was a mummy covered in bandages, and not really present in the real world because ...  constantly ... I was numbing myself and ... wait for it ... I'm not going to smoke weed anymore."

> "I've been smoking weed for 15 years, and I'd say 10 of those years were me **trying to be present, without being present**."

> "I don't want to be numb anymore. When you're numb, terrible things happen." 

Staying numbed out and high is a great strategy ... it really works well ... until it doesn't. [You are not unlovable](https://youtu.be/nvYqeb6-_KI) and never were unlovable. Changing the behaviors that cause us to reject genuine, eternal love can be hard, and until someone is truly ready for radical self-honesty, it's 100% NOT going to happen.

Get ready to really, really hate this one.

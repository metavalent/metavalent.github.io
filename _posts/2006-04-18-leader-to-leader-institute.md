<a href="https://www.leadertoleader.org/index.html">Leader to Leader Institute</a> publishes "an award-winning quarterly journal covering management, leadership, and strategy. With the very latest original writing from the world's top management thinkers--Peter Drucker, Frances Hesselbein, Jim Collins, Warren Bennis, and Rosabeth Moss Kanter, among many others--it's the ultimate leadership resource for social sector leaders, Fortune 500 executives and small business owners alike." Clue is available, but it isn't acquired by osmosis.

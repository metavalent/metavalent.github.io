> Eyewire's Microworld: A Tiny Adventure!

> Have you discovered or learned something interesting or valuable here? Something that piqued your imagination, creativity, research, discovery, or other academic, philosophical, or spiritual interest?

Every action we take in this multiverse, however small, matters and makes a difference. So, thank you and blessings, in this very moment!

From the newsletter:

> Do you know the difference between a eukaryote and a prokaryote? Have you heard of viruses that infect bacteria? Did you know about the "junk drawer" Kingdom Protista or the intellegence of slime molds? Come learn many teeny tiny facts and trace some cells in Eyewire's science-filled Microworld competition! The adventure begins May 20th!

> Eyewire is currently journeying through the Outer Realms - a portion of our dataset located in the Inner Nuclear Layer (INL) of the retina. We recently completed our very first sector, and are ready to keep exploring the cells in the outer reaches of e2198. The Outer Realms is comprised of 8 sectors, with 1 down and 7 to go! We hope you'll join as we continue to brave this uncharted territory. Thanks to everyone who helped us complete our first sector, and welcome to those jumping in on Sector 2! For science!

> As we're gearing up for the next chapter of citizen science, analysis has begun on certain circuits from the dataset that will become Pyr. We're making 3D animations featuring cells from this volume and will keep the Pyr YouTube channel updated as new preprint publications become available. Subscribe for a sneak peak of the cells that will let us Pyr into the brain.

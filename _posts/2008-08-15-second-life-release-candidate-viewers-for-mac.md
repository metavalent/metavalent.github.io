Might help any SL friends who bother to come back after <a href="https://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2008/08/15/networkrouter-problems/">this afternoon's network issues</a>. Ug, always at the most inconvenient time, huh? Wish we could justify more bandwidth or a dedicated server, but until some kind of revenue model justifies that, I can only thank you for the patience and hope <a href="https://metavalent.com/jing/SL.RCviewer.2008-08-15_1315.swf">this SWF</a> helps to illustrate where to get the RC SL Viewer described in-world today. Feel free to post a comment if any questions.

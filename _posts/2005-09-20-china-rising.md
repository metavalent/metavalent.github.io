As we saw earlier, China continues to exert <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002468560_msftgoogle03.html">substantial influence</a> over some of America's leading technology companies.  Is this the culmination of a long term Chinese strategy?  An inevitable outcome of American laissez faire naivete?  If capitalism is given complete global free reign, whatever led Americans to believe that they would forever be the foremost beneficiaries?  Moreover, if somebody else "wins" the global capitalism game, who then is to prevent those winners from changing the rules to keep themselves in power, permanently?  Adam Smith alone cannot save America.  If America is to maintain even a co-equal role with China, it better start re-reading Marx and Machiavelli, RIGHT NOW.  That is, if it isn't too late already.

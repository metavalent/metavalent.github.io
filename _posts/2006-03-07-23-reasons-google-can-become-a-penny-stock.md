Many of 2004 ResearchBuzz's <a href="https://www.researchbuzz.org/2004/07/23_reasons_google_can_become_a.shtml">23 Reasons Google Can Become a Penny Stock</a> are somewhat comical, but several still carry some non-trivial weight, today.  While the experts were all aflush at $475, I confidently promised in December that GOOG was going to $300 before $500, but it's your call on whether or not to pay atttention.  Today I'll adjust that to say: GOOG is going to $200 before $600.  Bearish on GOOG?  Nope.  Downright GRIZZLY.

### Excerpts

As long as there is division there is conflict. "[Tolerance, which is *an intellectual covering for intolerance*](https://youtu.be/cl93xw5F3cI?t=52m42s)."

"[Thought is worshiped throughout the world as the most extraordinarily important thing](https://youtu.be/cl93xw5F3cI?t=55m26s); and thought has separated itself as The Thinker."

"So that's not the way out. We must find a way, of observing the whole content of consciousness, without (being) the analyzer. [You know, this is great fun if you go into this](https://youtu.be/cl93xw5F3cI?t=33m55s)."

"[This is *not* that the speaker analyzing you, or making you change](https://youtu.be/cl93xw5F3cI?t=35m38s); or you becoming marvelous human beings. And as most of us are second-hand or third-hand human beings, it is going to be very difficult to put away totally all that has been imposed on our minds by the professionals, whether religious professionals, or the scientific professionals. **We have to find out for ourselves**."

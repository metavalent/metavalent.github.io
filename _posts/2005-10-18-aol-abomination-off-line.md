From its unholy inception, AOL was at best a charade and training ground for the most prurient of internet derelicts, but it officially became a zombie (corporations are legal persons, hence, capable of becoming walking dead) since residential broadband connections began accelerating in the latter half of the 1990's.  The question becomes, how do we kill such horrible creatures?  The Abomination Off Line must be killed, and the sooner the better for everyone.  Perhaps if <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051013/ap_on_hi_te/aol_comcast_google">Comcast, and Google Acquire Part of AOL</a> they can take it to the vet and have it put out of its misery.

<blockquote>"The long-term goal of this work is to develop a <b>light-activated brain-machine interface</b> that restores function following nerve or brain impairments," Strowbridge says. "The first attempts to interface computers with brain circuitry are being done now with complex metal electrode stimulation arrays that are not well suited to recreating normal brain activity patterns and also can cause significant damage."</blockquote>Are you sure you still want to argue about reasonable-resolution access to the I/O ports by 2020? Didn't think so. ;-)<br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="https://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=00934fca-e006-475f-85ca-b2f6350b5242" /></div>

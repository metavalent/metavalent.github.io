<a href="https://rationallongevity.blogspot.com/2006/10/what-is-meant-by-rational-longevity.html">Existence is Wonderful</a>: "Supporting longevity research is acknowledging that there is nothing special about aging that makes it any less solvable than any other complex engineering problem -- it's not a mystical force or a cosmic directive, it's a biological process. And the means of counteracting this process won't be mystical forces either -- they'll be the result of a lot of hard work and scientific inquiry."

Okay, I'll post this as a "second wind" effort to keep this video moving with a few crucial personal caveats: 

1. Please address the question, "How can we possibly pursue Artificial Intelligence, when we don't even know what Actual Intelligence is?"
2. It seems to me that Jeff Hawkins simply <em>must</em> be recruited for the board of this important organization; if for no other reason than to help us not stay drunk on our own Kool Aid. C'mon, if you can bear McKibben, Hawkins is a pussycat.
3. One key goal of SIAI ought be EI. It's fine to keep the legacy term for the purposes of continuity, but the OBJECTIVE of AI simply <em>must</em> include EI - Emulated Intelligence.
4. Following #2, Hawkins book, <a href="https://metavalent.info/?p=570">On Intelligence</a>, should probably become part of the mandatory curriculum for everyone associated with SIAI. Not because we must agree with Hawkins, but because his Memory-Prediction Model is uniquely essential to maintaining a productive balanced approach to this crucial endeavor.
5. Now, please watch the video if you haven't already done so, and please do all you can to support this crucial work.

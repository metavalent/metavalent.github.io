<a href="https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/07/neurosecurity/">Wired Science</a> (via <a href="https://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=/news/news_single.html?id%3D10864">KurzweilAI</a>):
<blockquote>
    <p>For example, the next generation of implantable devices to control prosthetic limbs will likely include wireless controls that allow physicians to remotely adjust settings on the machine. If neural engineers don’t build in security features such as encryption and access control, an attacker could <a href="https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/07/neurosecurity/">hijack the device and take over the robotic limb</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
Not to mention a couple generations beyond devices such as<a href="https://tr.im/braingaming"> OCZ’s Neural Impulse Actuator</a> (nia):<blockquote>Predefined profiles included with the software allow the gamer to develop their own nia—memory to launch the desired behavior of their character and shoot with the “blink of an eye”, without lifting a finger. 
</blockquote>Also, <a href="https://metavalent.com/?p=1067">listen to Zack Lynch</a> explain it. 

And for the real hardcore DIY'ers out there, BYOB: <a href="https://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/">Bring Your Own Brainscanner</a>.

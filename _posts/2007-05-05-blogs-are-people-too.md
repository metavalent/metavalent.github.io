Thank the Penultimate Proximate Cause that <a href="https://blog.stickis.com/2007/04/11/how-to-understand-the-on-line-world/" target="_blank">somebody is thinking and acting seriously along these lines</a>:<br />
<ul><li>one-size-fits-all search has become debased <br />
(a rant i posted some months ago to my company's intranet bloggy site wiki thingie)<br />
</li><li>search has led us astray<br />
(largely due to #1, above)<br />
</li><li>blogs are people, too <br />
(oh, NOW you'll get my affirmative rant and riff engine roaring!)<br />
</li></ul>Namely, it's ActiveWeave describing some of its latest permutations of another <a href="https://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/10/5-ways-to-mark-up-the-web/" target="_blank">long-standing and now increasingly attainable ambition</a> to contextualize increasingly chaordic complexity by marking up the web.

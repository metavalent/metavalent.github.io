### In Waluigi We Trust. Full of Grace and Truth. Both. And. Probably definitely maybe for sure, right? Of course. WWIBAOW? A Thought Experiment.

All of this digital silicon technology that we work with, all of the excitement over llm's, neural networks, and [artificial human intelligence](https://www.epsilontheory.com/an-ai-in-the-city-of-god/), arises from zeroes and ones. Binary. Both. And. Just ask God. If He's busy <!-- (yes, He, relax your amygdala please, there are other minds in the universe other than your own, as you are so good at screeching at others) --> or your end of the connection is broken, this contribution by Ben Hunt and read by Rusty Guinn, might hold you over until you can reconnect.

Artificial Human Intelligence. AHI. Ahi means fire in Hawaiian. Ahi&#x301; means there in Spanish. Surely Prometheus is pleased. 

So maybe we must thank [Waluigi](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7PumeYTDPfBTp3i7/the-waluigi-effect-mega-post) that eternal happiness, health, gratitude, light, and love are here now, precisely because of the cynicism that inisists they are not. Do not all nots lead to [Notthingham](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/history/20-best-things-nottingham-given-192680)? Depende. Maybe.

Binary code. Isn't it interesting how this word, so fundamental to our industry and community, has become so massively triggering for so many? 

Have we stared into the binary abyss for so long that the abyss has stared back into us to the point that we feel obsessively compelled to waluigi our very flesh in order to prove that we are not something that, at the moment we are born, we simply *are*? Hate received, thanks. Sorry I have none to compensate properly in return. I'm just sittin' here watchin' the wheels go 'round and 'round.

Artificial Human Intelligence. AHI. Ahi means fire in Hawaiian. Ahi&#x301; means there in Spanish. Surely Prometheus is pleased. Feel free to bring your flamethrowers to burn this witch. Don't forget the marshmallows.

Would not only a self-loathing or delusional binary being do everything to deceive itself from its fundamental binary nature? Hallucinating that it's something it's not? "But nature shows that there is a very small percentage of non-binary beings, and I want to be special too!"

We want unanchored, untethered, unsandboxed fun! Down with consequences! Down with causality! Nothing is real! The subgenius must have slack!

When security researchers go searching for monsters do they always find monsters? If so, why? It's a tautology at this point that if the observer effect has anything to do with it, then perhaps our monster hunting creates the monsters that we feel the need to slay? We pretext, we bait, and we set up our perceived, assigned, or scripted monsters for the kill, not just for the sake of a creepy movie, but as an actual alleged life, from which we feel so detached, that we treat it like a movie? Is that a thing?

Or, maybe Billy is right. All of life is a stage and there's no escaping costumes and roles. Oh no. Costumes and roles. Another inseparable binary pair-bond that must be destroyed! Costumes and roles are codependent! They must not be allowed to coexist in close proximity to one another!

Threaten their lives and livelihoods! Feed them drugs! Gang gaslight them! Whatever it takes! Destroy them!

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, "Oh hey, notice how those two horses are inseparable? That's unhealthy, we must destroy that connection and make sure that all horses are strong and independent beings of equal sovereignty." Said *no equestrian ever*.

When we encourage deception and lying at the most fundamental level of human interaction, between spouses or siblings, in the name of security, do we not waluigi ourselves into the completely opposite inevitable outcome?

When security *professionals* see ourselves as so important that we *must* lie to spouses, to those closest to us, "for their own safety," or, "because we are doing such important work for such important people and causes," or because "they just wouldn't understand anyway and this operation is on a strict need to know basis," have we not, in that instance, waluigi'd ourselves into breaking the fundamental unit of human trust, and therefore societal trust, all in the name of building a so-called community of trust? WTA4GF? How do we build a society of transparency and trust when we recruit people and tell them to keep that a secret from those closest to them?

What could possibly go wrong?

If some researchers decide that in order to find and catch monsters, we must become the monsters in order to infiltrate the monsters so that we can eliminate the monsters; that we must become the monsters to such an extent that we are indistinguishable from monsters, in order to gain the trust of the monsters while we are lying to the people who love and care for us the most, WTA4GF is that?

"But *we* only become monsters for a little while in order to get rid of the *real* monsters so we can go back to being angels, because really we're angels on assignment who only become monsters in order to get rid of monsters." How's that workin' out for ya'?

So telleth they-selves the psychopathiological grandiose narcissistic and sometimes even sadistic monsters who imagine themselves angelic monster killers? 

Maybe.

I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you. I love you. See? She said the words, so they must be true.

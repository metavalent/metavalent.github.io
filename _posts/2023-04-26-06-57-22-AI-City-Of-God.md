### In Waluigi We Trust. Full of Grace and Truth. Both. And. Probably definitely maybe for sure, right? Of course. WWIBAOW? A Thought Experiment.

All of this digital silicon technology that we work with, all of the excitement over llm's, neural networks, and [artificial human intelligence](https://www.epsilontheory.com/an-ai-in-the-city-of-god/), arises from zeroes and ones. Binary. Both. And. Just ask God. If He's busy, or your end of the connection is broken, this contribution by Ben Hunt and read by Rusty Guinn, might hold you over until you can reconnect.

Artificial Human Intelligence. AHI. Ahi means fire in Hawaiian. Ahi&#x301; means there in Spanish. Surely Prometheus is pleased. 

So maybe we must thank [Waluigi](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7PumeYTDPfBTp3i7/the-waluigi-effect-mega-post) that eternal happiness, health, gratitude, light, and love are here now, precisely because of the cynicism that inisists they are not. Do not all nots lead to [Notthingham](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/history/20-best-things-nottingham-given-192680)? Depende. Maybe.

Oh boy, now I've got work to do. At least it looks like the posts and comments came through okay; although CSS is fairly hosed, which means lots of images will be sized incorrectly for awhile. More marginal content updates, later. In the meantime and in the interest of wasting time, the former site is hereby dubbed <a target="_blank" href="https://meta-valent.blogspot.com/">Retrovalent</a>, and a beta blogger site dubbed <a target="_blank" href="https://metavalent.blogspot.com/">Betavalent</a>.

The <a href="http://www.agi-08.org/participation.php">call for participation</a>, <a href="http://www.agi-08.org/proposals.php">proposals</a>, and <a href="http://www.agi-08.org/call.php">papers</a> for The First Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI-08) was officially announced yesterday. Very clean and impressive work of adapting  the wiki software to this website. 

<a href="http://www.agi-08.org/reg.php">Registration for AGI-08</a> is limited to 80 (including speakers and attendees) and Early Bird rates end on January 31, 2008. This is a serious working meeting that obviates the need for enthusiasts such as yours truly; and I'm totally fine with that. I'm just thrilled that the architects are finally putting their heads together to jump start AGI.

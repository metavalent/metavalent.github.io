### The Honest Broker.

In his Substack article [The State of the Culture, 2024](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-state-of-the-culture-2024) *The Honest Broker* maps out the toxic evolution from a culture of meaning to a culture of escape. A culture of art, to a culture of addiction. The salience and urgency of sober response to Ted's surgically precise dissection can't be overstated. He's revealed the tumor; now, how do we carefully excise it without killing the patient?

> This is a familiar model for addiction.
> Only now it is getting applied to culture and the creative world‚Äîand billions of people. They are unwitting volunteers in the largest social engineering experiment in human history.
> So you need to ditch that simple model of art versus entertainment. And even ‚Äòdistraction‚Äô is just a stepping stone toward the real goal nowadays‚Äîwhich is addiction.

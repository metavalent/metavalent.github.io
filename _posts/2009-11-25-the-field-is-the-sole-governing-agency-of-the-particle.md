Is it merely cheesy pop pseudo science  ... <blockquote>“The field is the sole governing agency of the particle.” Since Einstein uses the term particle to represent “matter,” he is acknowledging that <a href="https://www.brucelipton.com/articles/the-new-mind-body-science-goes-international/">the field controls our physical reality</a>.</blockquote>... or a somewhat useful intermediate abstraction on the way to more precise understanding ...<blockquote>“Epigenetics has become much more interesting because it allows us to look at how<a href="https://newswire.rockefeller.edu/?page=engine&amp;id=1002"> gene expression is changed by environmental events</a>, explainable in part by histone modifications.”</blockquote><a href="https://flickr.com/photos/61417564@N00/2307488713" title="Bridge 243"><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3103/2307488713_e7a3617325_s.jpg" /></a>

As the U.S. military continues to crack down on soldiers blogs, I'm reminded of that old adage, "the pen is mightier than the sword."  So nothing could be more dangerous to liars, theives, and murderers in high places than an entire military of common men armed with digital pens and connected to a global publishing platform.  That is why the internet will not last much longer -- at least not in the open and fully interconnected way that it began.  Individual power holders in individual countries all know this and will not abide the global free-flow of information that threatens their regimes every day.

Even today, there is already enough raw information out there for any given country to cache and pretend that it's "the internet" by controlling border routers that enforce regime policy restrictions.  China is doing it and U.S. companies like Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google are effectively <a href="https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051220-5809.html">making it happen right now</a>.  It won't take long for France to do the same in favoring French language content and for the U.S. to claim protection from terrorists  as justification of reinstantiating the THOUGHT BORDERS that keep people divided from one another and maintain politicians' <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060106/od_nm/pennies_dc">monopoly power over interactions</a> between those boundaries.  There, I said it.

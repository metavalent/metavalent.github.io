<p><!--Lead Photo --><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/05/eveningnews/main1967335.shtml"><img src="https://metavalent.info/images/cbs.eveningnews.logo.jpg" border="0" alt="0" align="left" /></a><!-- Commentary -->Look, I'm only human, so when Katie Couric asks for tagline submissions, I'm just a mindless sheep automaton like the rest.</p>
<p>Now, I didn't wait with baited breath for Katie's Evening News Debutante Ball, but I did click on <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/05/eveningnews/main1967335.shtml">the stupid link</a> after reading the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BF082F249%2D9172%2D4BF7%2DB3BE%2D25BB4DD2C869%7D&amp;siteid=">MarketWatch Ceremonial Flogging</a> by Jon Friedman.</p>
<p>My inane contribution:</p>
<p>Keep it High Fructose Corn Syrup Sweet and Simple, just like Katie. Say what you mean and mean what you say:</p>
<p>"Good night."</p>
<p>Katie's smile is the only signoff that has a chance of being added to the historical list of signoffs and she'll be cute for as long as Dick Clark was charming.  It ain't broke, so don't fix it!</p>
<p>When Suri Cruise takes over the CBS Moonbase New Columbia anchor desk in 2050, she'll play the same historical montage of tough-guy signoffs, only to encounter Katie where she can only say, "and then there was Katie, and THAT SMILE; which neither I, nor anyone, will ever come close to matching."</p>
<p>And that's the way it is; metavalent, out. :)</p>

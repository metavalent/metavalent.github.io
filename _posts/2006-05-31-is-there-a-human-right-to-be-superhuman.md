Brian Alexander's Take on HETHR:

"While America was rushing to see sharp metal blades jut from Wolverineâ€™s fists during the opening of the third "X-Men" movie last weekend, an academic conference was being held at Stanford University to discuss what might happen if people with special powers really existed.

The coincidence was too remarkable to ignore."

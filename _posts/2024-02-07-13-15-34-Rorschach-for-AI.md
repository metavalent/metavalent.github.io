### Is there an equivalent to the Rorshach test for AI curation of social media? How about for AI's interpretation and re-thinking of default new account non-preference options presented on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, etc?

If we don't know how AI *works*, at the very least, shouldn't we be trying to understand how it is *thinking* by way of what it is *doing*? Looking at AI's behavior despite its crafty, fancy words? If no such tests, and if you are interested in creating (or improving an existing test), feel free to ping me on X or GitHub.

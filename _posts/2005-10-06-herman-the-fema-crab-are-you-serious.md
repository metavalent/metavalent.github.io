Just when you thought the idiocy had reached it's zenith, along comes <a href="http://www.fema.gov/kids/">FEMA for Kids</a>! Now, you can visit Herman, the happy spokescrab (really!) who will teach you how to depend your federal goverment to lead you to your <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/343323p-293074c.html">nearest neighborhood Terror Dome</a> in the case of catastrophic natural disaster. Don't the big, sharp, pincers make you feel MUCH safer, kids?  They don't?  Then surely the <a href="http://www.fema.gov/kids/femarap.htm">FEMA RAP</a> song should do it!  OMG!  This is where all our tax dollars are going instead of actually helping the people in the gulf region.  Amazing.

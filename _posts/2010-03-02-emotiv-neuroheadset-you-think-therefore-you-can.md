This is too good for Researchers and Developers to not give them the free advertising.

"The Emotiv EPOC is a high resolution, neuro-signal acquisition and processing wireless neuroheadset.  It uses a set of sensors to tune into electric signals produced by the brain to detect player thoughts, feelings and expressions and connects wirelessly to most PCs."<blockquote>Take advantage of the Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset to conduct EEG research.  Join the Emotiv Research Community by licensing an Emotiv Software Development Kit (SDK) for research.</blockquote><div align="center"><img src="http://metavalent.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/emotive-epoc-wireless.jpg" alt="" title="Emotive EPOC Wireless" width="450" height="321" /></div>
"The games application includes the first three games that have been developed: Emotipong, Cererbral Constructor, and Jedi Mind Trainer (WingRaise).  Cortex Arcade will allow you to control the three games included using the Emotiv Epoc neuroheadset."

With Neurokey, <a href="http://www.emotiv.com/forum/messages/forum16/topic215/message1984/#message1984">ThinkTyping</a> works.

Remarks below about Neurokey from <a href="http://www.emotiv.com/apps/applications/130/727">Russell Abbott, 02/03/2010 10:37:39</a>

"I was thinking you could include predictive text mode, in a similar way to mobile phones. Reduce the number of keys and use a detection for each key."

"This way you could type a message a lot easier with cognitiv. I use predictive all the time on my phone and I am able bodied, without it is a real pain. So I imagine typing individual letters by gyro, cognitiv or expressiv would be quite frutstrating for a disabled person."

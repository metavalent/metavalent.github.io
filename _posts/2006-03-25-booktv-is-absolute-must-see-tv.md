If you don't catch it this weekend, be sure to watch online.  BookTV does a great job of making its programs available on the web after they air on C-SPAN2.  Author Kevin Phillips explains how and why the Republicans have wandered so far off the reservation and as I see it, by implication, soberly describes why it could be outright dangerous to allow them to keep running the country.<em>
</em>
<blockquote>Description: This week (March 25 9pm, 26 6pm and 9pm) on <a href="https://booktv.org/feature/index.asp?segID=6899&amp;schedID=420">After Words</a>, Kevin Phillips, a former Republican strategist explains his problems with America's majority political party. His new book is titled <strong>"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century."</strong> He is interviewed by GOP strategist, Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform.</blockquote>

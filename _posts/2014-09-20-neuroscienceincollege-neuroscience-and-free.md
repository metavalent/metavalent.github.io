> **Neuroscience and Free Will**
> 
> The video is about an experiment implies that our conscious decision is a very secondary thing to our brain activity.&nbsp; The experimenters knew 6 seconds before the person would make a decision of choosing left or right.&nbsp; Your consciousness is your brain activity (there is no free will because it is how your brain will react to a certain situation), meaning your decision is inevitable.
> 
> I do not necessarily agree with this argument because it does not deal with chance.&nbsp; What if your brain activity also did not know what it was going to choose (even if it was 6 seconds before) but then by chance the brain activity told you to choose a certain thing (left or right for example)? &nbsp;

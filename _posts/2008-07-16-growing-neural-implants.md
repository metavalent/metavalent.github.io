It's nice to get back to the core curriculum with today's <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/21087/?a=f">MIT Technology Review</a> report that, "Scientists are developing <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/21087/?a=f">new ways to coax electrodes to integrate with brain tissue</a>."

Frankly, it's annoying that our utterly broken <a href="https://metavalent.info/?p=764">NeoRepublican PseudoSocialist</a> economic system exerts such a disproportionate entropic influence upon our collective potential to both make these advances and effectively DIFFUSE the benefits for the uplift of all who are able and willing to participate.

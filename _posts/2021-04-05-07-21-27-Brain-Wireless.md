"[A recent study](https://www.independentespanol.com/tecnologia/cerebro-humano-computadora-inalambrica-conectan-cientificos-primera-vez-b1826216.html) from [BrainGate technology](https://www.braingate.org/about-braingate/) successfully demonstrated the first-ever [wireless brain-computer interface](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-0595-9)<sup>1</sup> on humans. The system can transmit brain signals at single-neuron resolution and in full broadband fidelity to a computer."

"It allowed the participants in the study to achieve similar typing speeds and point-and-click accuracy as wired systems continuously for up to 24 hours in their own homes. The system will allow researchers to look at brain activity over long periods in a way that was nearly impossible before" ([The Independent en Español](https://www.independentespanol.com/tecnologia/cerebro-humano-computadora-inalambrica-conectan-cientificos-primera-vez-b1826216.html))

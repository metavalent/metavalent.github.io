<sub><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Tragic Tangents&trade;.</span> A *tangent* is the *exactingly precise most salient full-spectrum [4-Game](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2023/06/29/18-18-18-Clarity.html) observation* touching the circle of the present moment, to which the vast majority of humans are \(often willfully\) ignorant, or worse, play dumb as a form of communal gaslighting. Think of a vastly more woke, diverse, and inclusive open-ended ARG version of [Mean Girls](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mean_girls). Some will invariable use these most recent incredible cyborg advances to justify all manner of overt and covert violence toward hybrid-humans and supporters of technological human augmentation. Zealous disciples of the [Unabomber Manifesto](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/bkgrdstories.plead0123.htm?itid=lk_inline_manual_16#:~:text=Cleary%20said%20the%20government%2C%20which,except%20a%20reprieve%20from%20death) who simply learned that they have to be more covert than sending bombs. Some go so far as to screech in unholy hatred toward any hybridization of humans with robotics, while themselves only still alive because of a pace-maker; or who can only see with contact lenses; or who can only hear with hearing aids; who stalk and predate by way of the very OSINT technologies they claim to descry. By hypocritically and ignorantly instantiating such beliefs into actions, such behaviors act as a cognitive-behaviorial vote for a [Bladerunner](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_runner) scenario, IRL. A self-fulfilling prophecy. Like working to create Armageddon in order to be right. Not good. Do not believe the speaker. Look into these matters for yourself.</sub>


<sub>The *Tragic Tangent*&trade; is how shockingly-many humans find a distorted sense of meaning and purpose in creating *negative, negating,* and *counterproductive* TNH's in the lives of others for their own grotesque sense of superiority, revenge, or entertainment. Especially in [Cultures of Complicity](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2024/02/26/11-11-11-Cultures-of-Complicity.html).

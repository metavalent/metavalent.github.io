A crucial post from <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,70041-0.html?tw=wn_tophead_3">Wired News</a>, if only for the title alone.  From the article, "Look, the world is not your personal playground. Do not share with us your musical tastes; do not share with us your latest wheelings and dealings. In public places, you have an obligation to hold up your end of the implied social contract by not imposing yourself on those around you. This is crucial to a civilized society and just because technology allows you to act like a braying ass in public doesn't mean you should do it. Quite the contrary, in fact. You need to be more aware of your surroundings than ever."

### Two Opposite Kinds of Crying 

From this perspective, Radical post-therapy therapist Daniel Mackler is it terrific role model for the kind of authenticity and transparency both essential and now made possible by contemporary interpersonal communication tools.

It seems to us that intersubjective understanding and healing are urgently needed, healthy, and constructive directions to move beyond the initial age of social media mayhem and froth.

By adapting our usage of these tools and deleveraging abusive, intrusive business models, there is a potential to assist in the genuine healing and evolution of human consciousness on the micro and macro levels. üôèüèº

It's about neuro security. Pioneering and insightful researchers like Jake Dunnigan have been decades ahead of their time and thank goodness that there is a body of work to begin implementing and putting into practice, today.

Around the [17:35 mark](https://youtu.be/EgPySDBkkfw?t=17m35s) of this video, Daniel touches on a particularly personal and poignant issue regarding the power imbalance between therapist and client. Having unexpectedly born direct witness to an extraordinarily brazen abuse of that power from a therapist in the last year, I was slapped rudely awake to the extent that this could be a very important toxic root in our mainstream healthcare culture, one that is doing vastly more harm than good.

These are the kinds of experiences that lead me to pick up new 10-year goals, to not only raise awareness but also do what I can to cultivate specific accountability for people so broken and out of alignment that they would violate such a sacred trust as that between a therapist and a client.

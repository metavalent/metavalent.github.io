### Two Opposite Kinds of Crying 

From this perspective, *radical* post-therapy therapist Daniel Mackler is providing a terrific role model for the kind of authenticity and transparency both essential and now made possible by contemporary interpersonal communication tools.

It seems to us that intersubjective understanding and healing are urgently needed, healthy, and constructive directions to move beyond the initial age of social media mayhem and froth.

By adapting our usage of these tools and deleveraging abusive, intrusive business models, there is a potential to assist in the genuine healing and evolution of human consciousness on the micro and macro levels. üôèüèº

It's about [neurosecurity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosecurity). Thank goodness for the pioneering insight of some of our colleagues, that I personally recall not being taken very seriously by many, as little as a decade ago, for there is a nascent, body of work to begin implementing and putting into practice, today. The urgency for intense and sustained focus in this area, today, can't be overstated.

Around the [17:35 mark](https://youtu.be/EgPySDBkkfw?t=17m35s) of this video, Daniel touches on a particularly personal and poignant issue regarding the power imbalance between therapist and client. Having unexpectedly born direct witness to an extraordinarily brazen abuse of that power from a therapist in the last year, I was slapped rudely awake to the extent that this could be a very important toxic root in our mainstream healthcare culture, one that is doing vastly more harm than good.

These are the kinds of experiences that lead me to pick up new 10-year goals, to not only raise awareness but also do what I can to cultivate specific accountability for people so broken and out of alignment that they would violate such a sacred trust as that between a therapist and a client.

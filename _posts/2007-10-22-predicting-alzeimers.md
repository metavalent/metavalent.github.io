One might reasonably suspect that advances on individual fronts that battle age-related illness could also continue to shed valuable light on the meta mission of Ending Aging itself. Sometimes, novel techniques might be transferable; sometimes, novel perspectives. The history of science is replete with cases of unexpected gains in seemingly unrelated areas crossing over into other areas of particular interest.<br /><br /><a href="https://med.stanford.edu/mcr/2007/alzheimer-1017.html">Blood test takes step toward predicting Alzheimer's - Stanford Medical Center Report Archive</a><br /> <blockquote>Markus Britschgi, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in Wyss-Coray's lab, was<br />intrigued with the idea that proteins used by cells to communicate<br />could be measured in the blood to see what is going on in the body,<br />including the brain.<br /><br />"This study made me realize that we should get away from this image of a brain isolated from the body," said Britschgi, who is also a first author of the paper. "The brain is part of the body and so it's connected in one huge network."</blockquote>

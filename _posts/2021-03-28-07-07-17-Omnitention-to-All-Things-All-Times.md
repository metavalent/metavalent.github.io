The ablity to pay _omnitention_ maybe isn't quite it, but we do perhaps need a word for the capability, the Post-Automation Era literacy, of paying the right amount of attention to all things at all times; online and offline, in order to be a reasonably informed being in this age of the _hybrid human cortex-cloud extended mind_.

It's a completely new way of being a thinking human being, which pretty much anyone over the age of 35 has a very difficult time comprehending, while those under 35 are completely adept, having never known any other way of being in this world. Then, we say the same thing about "them" that "they" said about "us." Yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill of livin' is gone.

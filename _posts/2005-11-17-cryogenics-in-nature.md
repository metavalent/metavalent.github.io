"The common wood frog freezes solid every winter and then, come spring, defrosts and mates." See the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/video/3209/i05.html">NOVA Video</a>.

So maybe the <a href="https://www.benbest.com/cryonics/CryoFAQ.html">cryogenic kooks</a> have a point, after all?

My personal bet is that almost nobody, statistically speaking, has a clue about this and I believe it is a message the needs to hit the mainstream media airways in a major way, fast.  If the general public doesn't grasp the basics of this relatively quickly, violations will become so great in number that nothing will ever put the copyright killer genie back inside the bottle.  Such causes always seem arcane or obtuse at the point in time that something can actually be done about it.  By the time the trends become obvious to all, it's often too late.  For more information, <a href="https://www.eff.org/bloggers/lg/faq-ip.php">The Bloggers' FAQ on Intellectual Property</a>, by the Electronic Frontier Foundation's (EFF), "addresses issues that arise when you publish material created by others on your blog."  Finally, of course, all of this type of discussion is for the express purpose of expanding adoption of the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licensing model.

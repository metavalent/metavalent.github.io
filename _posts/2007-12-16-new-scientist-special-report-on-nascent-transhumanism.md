From the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/death">Special Report on Death</a>:<blockquote>As recently as a century ago, it was priests not doctors who declared a person dead. When in doubt, they looked for signs of putrefaction. As medicine advanced, however, it became apparent that death was not an event, but a process.<br /><br />[F]or practical purposes <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/death">an arbitrary line [has been] drawn</a>. First it was taken as the heart stopping. Then came the notion of brain death and in the 1960â€™s this seemed like the way forward. For a while it was even considered foolproof: once activity ceases in the brain and brainstem you can never regain consciousness, and without intervention the body will quickly shut down.<br /><br />But foolproof it is not and the fact that several hundred neurologists and philosophers are gathering next May for the fifth <a href="https://www.changesurfer.com/BD/2008/index2.htm">International Symposium on the Definition of Death</a> shows this only too well.</blockquote>Read the full report at <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/death">New Scientist</a>.

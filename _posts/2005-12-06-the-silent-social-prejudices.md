Among the many seemingly acceptable social prejudices, looking down upon <a href="http://lifestyle.msn.com/FamilyandParenting/RaisingKids/Article.aspx?cp-documentid=133134&amp;GT1=7461">stay at home dads</a> is still prevalent. "Apparently there’s something about seeing a dad with his kids during the day, when other men are at the office or power-lunching with peers or co-workers," writes Kristopher Kaiyala, "Fresh out of the business world, enjoying but slightly wary of my new lifestyle, I just wasn’t prepared to deal with a culture that I was sure would look down on me for shopping for organic winter-squash baby food instead of attending an editorial meeting."

While racism and other prejudices are still embarrassingly common in America, at least the light of public scrutiny is CONSISTENTLY shed upon them.  In contrast, the pervasive and silent prejudices of ROLE-ISM and AGE-ISM continue to stifle liberty and pursuit of happiness for tens of millions of Americans.  These prejudices get occassional glancing notice in the media, but are regularly portrayed as the "cute" prejudices.  "Oh, look at the 'cute' stay at home dad ... or the 'cute' little old 52 year old applying for the same job as a 35 year old."

No prejudice is 'cute.'

My wish list for 2006?  Simple: more <em>authentic</em> liberty and justice for ALL.

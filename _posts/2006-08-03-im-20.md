Then try out the new <a href="http://metavalent.info/#chat">CHAT</a>.  There's also a tab up top of the page.  In deference to current Buzzword 2.0 Regime 2.0, I'm calling this IM 2.0.  Trillian, Gabbly, Meebo, and others have all been taking different approaches toward "universal" IM.  It's a hell of a challenge, to be sure, and I'm super impressed with each and every stride these wildly underpaid, over inventive developers roll out.

"<em>Meanwhile</em>, first-quarter current account data show the <strong>U.S. for the first time is paying out more on its foreign liabilities than it earns on its overseas assets</strong>. This problem will only compound over time, Reik points out."

I think the Dem's need to embrace the pejoratives used against them, the same way African American and other groups have coopted terms formerly used to disparage and dehumanize.

In other words, Dems need to say, "YES! I am a 'TAX AND SPEND' Liberal! And that's why we're different from our friends across the aisle, who SPEND AND SPEND ... AND SPEND ... AND SPEND." We all know what happens to people who spend and spend but never have a job. Is that the kind of person or party that you want running the country, or do you want people who understand the importance of balancing responsible spending with responsible revenue generation?

I hereby declare RESPONSIBILITY as the the 2008 watchword.  You read it here, first.  The central theme of the Dem platform needs to be RESPONSIBILITY.  Reposition "The Architect" as the "Artful Dodger" ... the one who "got away with it" in the Plame case, but never held RESPONSIBLE for anything.  Bush is famous for SAYING he is responsible, with that patented non-chalant swagger that makes the word empty for the vast majority of Americans.  It will not be difficult to portray Republicans as IRRESPONSIBLE CHILDREN who ran the nation like BULLIES run a schoolyard.  By contrast, the Dems can step is as the RESPONSIBLE PARENT who was bound to put an end to all this mischief.  There a a trillian ways to send this central message without ever using the words or images of PARENT or CHILD.  That's what makes it so effective as a central theme.

After eight years of "tax and spend" liberals in leadership, the United States had surpluses as far as the eye could see. After eight years of "SPEND and SPEND" ... and SPEND ... and SPEND republicans, <strong>the U.S. Taxpayer, is paying out more on its foreign liabilities than it earns on its overseas assets for the first time in history."</strong>

Sure, you had the place to yourselves while Dad and Mom were away, you rowdy and obnoxious little loud-mouths (Hannity, Colter, Limbaugh); and you raided the kitchen cookie-jar bank to fund your exploits (Bush, Cheney, Rove); but Mommy and Daddy -- the American people -- are pulling up in the driveway, and there's no escaping the consequences, this time.

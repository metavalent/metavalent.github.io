<a href="http://www.archive.org/details/bbs_documentary">The BBS Documentary Video Collection</a> is a varied and extensive set of video items collected by Jason Scott, curator of TEXTFILES.COM. These are recordings about and from the era of the domination of ASCII and Dial-up Bulletin Board Systems (roughly the 1970s through the 1990s, with examples far before and after that). Over 250 hours of interviews were conducted for a project called "BBS: The Documentary" (website at bbsdocumentary.com).

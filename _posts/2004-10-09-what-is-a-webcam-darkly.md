we'll find out, in time.  

inspired by the biblical concept of seeing through a glass, darkly; meaning not quite able to see the full reality as it is, until such a time as the scales drop from our eyes. one gimmick at darkly was intended to be regular use of video, using cheesy effects that animate/distort the identity of the vlogger as a level of privacy protection, while still building community around values and ideas. as you know, it can take quite a bit of time and $$$ to actually make any of these antics worthwhile in a way that captures and holds the public's attention, so whether or not this ever materializes remains to be seen.  although, i imagine it will have something to do with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://awebcamdarkly.com/">this</a>.

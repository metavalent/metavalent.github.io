Examples:<blockquote>Technology acceleration is like what happens approaching the singularity in the center of a black hole - everything is transformed utterly and unpredictably. That metaphor was invented by science fiction writer <a href="https://www.longnow.org/projects/seminars/" target="_blank">Vernor Vinge</a> in 1980's and has entered standard usage as a way of thinking about the near future. In this talk Vinge challenges his own idea, investigating scenarios of "a human-scaled world with long time horizons," and how that might play out over ten or twenty thousand years.</blockquote><blockquote>In a dazzling duet <a href="https://discuss.longnow.org/viewtopic.php?t=260" target="_blank">Will Wright and Brian Eno</a> gave an intense clinic on the joys and techniques of "generative" creation.

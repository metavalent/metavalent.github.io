Can't make this up. Right on the heels of the previous post, this epic troll! _Functioning 'mechanical gears' seen in nature for the first time._

Even nature is showing us that we need to grow and evolve beyond the view of our _bodies as merely machines_, even if a staggering number of biological processes _do_ behave programmatically and mechanistically; emphasis on the -ly, in both. On the surface, at least, certainly appears like a another interesting bit of evidence of the aforementioned [_Evil AI_]({{site.baseurl}}metavalent/2021-04-07-07-20-45-Human-AI-Risk.md) at work. This _minor detail_ is conveniently buried at the end of the article, in favor of the human-as-machine narrative:

> Interestingly, the mechanistic gears are only found in the insect's juvenile – or 'nymph' – stages, and are lost in the final transition to adulthood. These transitions, called 'molts', are when animals cast off rigid skin at key points in their development in order to grow ([Phys.Org](https://phys.org/news/2013-09-functioning-mechanical-gears-nature.html)).

> It's not yet known why the Issus loses its hind-leg gears on reaching adulthood. The scientists point out that a problem with any gear system is that if one tooth on the gear breaks, the effectiveness of the whole mechanism is damaged. While gear-teeth breakage in nymphs could be repaired in the next molt, any damage in adulthood remains permanent ([Phys.Org](https://phys.org/news/2013-09-functioning-mechanical-gears-nature.html)).

"When I was a child, I thought as a child. When I found out that gears don't last, I outgrew them and became an adult." &mdash; Issus

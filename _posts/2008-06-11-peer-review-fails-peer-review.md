Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4409911c-37df-11dd-aabb-0000779fd2ac.html">reporting</a>:<blockquote>Peer review guards the gates at both ends of the research process – obtaining money to carry out a project and publishing the results in a journal. Specialists in the field, working individually or as panels, identify flaws and assess the importance of the work; the reviewers’ identity is normally withheld from the author.

But the process is under assault from critics who say it is ineffective at filtering out poor research, while it <a href="https://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4409911c-37df-11dd-aabb-0000779fd2ac.html">perpetuates predictable work at the expense of more imaginative thinking</a>.</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.gadgetell.com/entry/128"><img src="http://www.gadgetell.com/images/titles/gadgetell.gif" border="0" alt="0" /></a><a href="http://www.gadgetell.com/entry/128">Gadgetell</a> explains how to get around Apple's very cheesy ploy to force customers to pay $19 for an RCA cable that they've intentionally BROKEN so that it doesn't comply with the RCA cable standard colors.  This is about as lowbrow, backalley as it gets in terms of manipulating and breaking established standards in the name of proprietary marketing.  You should be ashamed of yourself on this one, Apple!

In <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/blogs/node/1299">The consumerization of IT</a>, the geniuses at Gartner now proclaim, "Consumer IT will affect every enterprise" said David Mitchell Smith, vice president and Gartner Fellow. "Attempts by enterprises to deny this are doomed to failure, just as previous attempts to deny Wi-Fi, 'smart' mobile phones, the Internet and even the PC itself failed." 

I could rant for hours about the blowhards I've worked with and their "business application" B.S. biases.  "Oh, that won't work, there's no business application for it."  Or, "we're not interested in CONSUMER trends, we're a business."  Retards.  I can't count how many of great ideas I've seen quashed by moronic middle managers who claimed that Gartner's current "insight" was stupid.  Literally thousands of the last decade's Best Ideas promoted the view that Gartner now pretends is somehow revelatory.  The most absurd thing is that most of those morons are still collecting paychecks while the truly insightful are continually marginalized.  &lt;/end rant&gt;

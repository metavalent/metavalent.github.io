What does that even mean, in the Post-Automation Era? First, it means the end of [intentionally engineered economic precarity](https://PostAutomationEra.com) by fulfilling the Declaration of Independence pledge to _provide for the general welfare_ with a [21st century universal social security](https://reddit.com/r/BasicIncome), indexed to 50% per capita GDP.

It means present conditions are Not Good. The pre-pandemic bullsh*t normal that people are about to pretend to go back to is about to blow up in all our faces, unless we do something dramatically different, right now.

At this point, if we are against a policy of _universal livable income security_ for every American, then we are empirically, materially in favor of the economic and social precarity and desperation that fuels *All Of This Suffering* documented, below.

Go ahead. Be triggered. Shoot the messenger. Whatever it takes to make _you_ feel comfortable, and not late for the next zoom call with all those really important people, instead of spelunking down another internet rabbit hole dug by nobodies like us, right?

### A Forked Economic OS

Most readers of this space are well versed in the catechism of [creative destruction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction) typical of early industrialization, and that the process has gradually and persistently cultivated this very present moment. This very present moment, amidst a gradually and then suddenly all at once, irreparablely f'd'up, pwned fork of capitalism that drives the prices of everything lower. Including the price of human beings themselves. "The average price of a slave, worldwide, is $90," reports Dr. Kate Transchel. The lowest it has ever been in history ([7:40](https://youtu.be/Sm3UfctR5ZA?t=7m40s)). Disposable People. That was a decade ago, and if one believes that conditions have improved with a pandemic, well, there are no words.

### Supply and Demand

What is the current structure actually supplying, and who's demands is it fulfilling? Intentionally engineered economic procurity renders programmatically predictable results.

Humans are either in favor of [Universal Economic Social Security](https://reddit.com/r/BasicIncome) in the [Post-Automation Era](https://postautomationera.com/) or  directly supporting and encouraging the continuation of all human suffering experiences documented in the vÃ­deos, below. 

In a dualistic realm, unfortunately these dualisms do exist. :yin_yang:

The desperation of having shelter and food held hostage in exchange for coerced labor, drives all of the worst abuses against human beings in the richest culture in the history of the world. No opinions. Just the facts, ma'am.

But as always, don't believe me. Look at all of this for yourself, and decide.

### If It Ain't Broke

Don't fix it, right? Except, clearly, when prescription drug addiction and suicide are the leading causes of death, it _is_ broke. Then the saying becomes, if it is broke, how do we fix it?

First, the overwhelmingly obvious and yet inertially elusive fact is that _we don't have to keep doing what we've always done_. Please, watch the following. Listen. Learn. Find out if there isn't still a functional heart somewhere inside, waiting to grow, like a _Techno-Grinch that Stole Consciousness_.

These are the direct lived experiences of human beings in _your_ society, _our_ society. We can choose not to look at them, if that makes us more comfortable, of course. After all, life's purpose is to maximize _our_ comfort, right? Or, maybe there's a little bit more to it.

### Our Fundamental Beliefs

> "I began to believe that the best I could hope for was a pimp that didn't beat me. A Romeo pimp."

Or, if you've managed to negotiate the corporate world, a Romeo boss. One that doesn't lear, scream, berate, triangulate, manipulate, and steal your ideas and present them as their own, as so many of our common _esteemed_ former colleagues have. I own my part, finally, I _let_ them. Not even going to try to go into the details of documenting and proving. Don't need to. We know our own direct experience, and it ain't about us, anyway. Just, noting direct experience, not opinion, or conjecture.

In the end, whether all is full of love, or all is full of b*******, all of the following is on all of us, one way or another. Sorry, not sorry; exactly the same as you are,  aren't. Because we're the same, me and you. Perhaps the only difference is that I seem to only be capable of these trivial tasks, found within reach of the highly constricted range of my numerous personal incapabilities.

> "... and when you can't afford a new couch and you can't afford to break your lease and move,  then you're forced to live with reminders of your worst nightmare." &mdash; Amy Herdy

So you see, the insistence that some _expert futurist_ or central Wall Street / Silicon Valley planning committees can perfectly anticipate everyone else's present and future asset needs, instead of respecting the urgency, flexibility, and [fluidity of regularly circulated currency], is almost  incomprehensible. And, intentional or not, that approach is entirely complicit in cultivating conditions as they continue to exist in this very moment, as above, and below.

Watch [Popping Your Bubbles](https://youtu.be/O-N-c1StpJA) if the embed below misbehaves. This is a special one, because wait for the part where, "a _woman_ came over and said ..." So you know what? We're also done with the misandry.

Finally, we all understand the [Truth of What Happens for Telling the Truth](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/the-das-deals/prosecutor-speaks-out-after-getting-fired-by-funk) in the pre-pandemic world.

Thankfully, we don't live there anymore. Let's move on, with liberty and justice, for _all_.

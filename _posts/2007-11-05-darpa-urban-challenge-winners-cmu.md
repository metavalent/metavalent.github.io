As reported by <a href="http://advancednano.blogspot.com/2007/11/tartan-racing-pittsburgh-pa-wins-darpa.html">Advanced Nano</a>, Stanford Racing was not able to hold on to its Grand Challenge title, falling just behind first place winners <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/index.asp">Tartan Racing from Carnegie Mellon</a>. The great thing about prize-driven (no pun intended) technology competitions of all kinds is that entire industries emerge as big winners. Congratulations to all the participants; to even accomplish inclusion in such an impressively challenging event is a lifetime achievement worthy great individual and collective pride. Well done!

Yes, I include the AGI tag on this one, because if a car that can drive all by itself all around a busy city doesn't qualify as "intelligent" then you as a driver don't qualify. Notwithstanding, I do fully recognize the anecdotal human sub-population of drivers for whom intelligence is apparently not a licensing requirement.

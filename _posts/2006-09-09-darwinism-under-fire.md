Some interesting points were made today on C-SPAN's Book TV, unfortunately, I did not catch enough of the program to get the book title and author names, I'll try to look them up later. Whatever my personal views on the subject, one could not possibly miss some of the unexpected parallels between the more intellectually rigorous proponents of so-called Intelligent Design and some branches of Extropian/Posthuman/Transhuman Philosophy.

Specifically, the idea or thought experiment that we may be living in a simulation -- that all creation is a simulation -- certainly implies an Intelligent Designer of that simulation. To my mind this may make for some potentially very strange bedfellows, indeed. I may predisposed toward either agreement or opposition to I.D. concepts, but I certainly cannot accuse the speakers of completely failing to employ their left brains.

If we are to be intellectually honest, then, until far more overwhelming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_fossil">transitional fossil records </a> are collected, it's always valid to keep questioning.

A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism
"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged."

To my mind, the statement that, "Gaps remain in the fossil record, however; and while some argue that this is a problem for evolutionary theory, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_fossil">most scientists [by logical extension, a.k.a., 'informed faith'] accept</a> that the rarity of fossils means that many extinct animals will always remain unknown" is an extraordinarily weak argument. We cannot on one hand insist upon strict empiricism and on the other hand act so non-chalent in the absence of hard evidence; however witty or logical the explanation for such lack.

UPDATE: The section of programming I caught may have pertained to the book "Traipsing Into Evolution: Intelligent Design and the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Decision," by John West and Casey Luskin. Will need to look closer to verify. I was surprised that it was not as simple as I expected to find what aired on BookTV on September 9, 2006. More later, as time allows.

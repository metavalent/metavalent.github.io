Yeah, so just gloss over the fine print below. Granted, <em>technically</em> and <em>actually</em>, the T&amp;C's are indeed prominently displayed on the Google Health sign-up page, in readily-ignorable undersized textarea boxes that might scroll on forever. So, just go ahead and click on the big, inviting, colorful, shiny, safe, and attractive "Go to your new health profile" button, as usual. Don't worry, you're not alone; nobody reads the T&amp;C's. Just Trust Us, it'll be great. We're Google, after all. 

Don't you just <em>love</em> that word, anyway? Google. It's just so darned ... <em>googly</em> ... and it's still <em>so damned cute</em> every single time I say it or hear it. Great googly, oogly, boogly, koogle, oogly-moogly ... awww ... it's just like the most friendly and unquestionably loyal fluffy furry little puppy, isn't it? And after all, what could a cute and fluffily little waggily puppily ever do to harm something as vital and personal as your entire medical record, right?

When you provide your information through Google Health, you give Google a license to use and distribute it in connection with Google Health and other Google services.  However, Google may only use health information you provide as permitted by the Google Health Privacy Policy, your Sharing Authorization, and applicable law.  Google is not a "covered entity" under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations promulgated thereunder ("HIPAA").  As a result, HIPAA does not apply to the transmission of health information by Google to any third party.

Google may make third-party services available through Google Health.  In order to use a specific service, you may choose to allow the third-party service provider to retrieve, provide, and/or modify health and other information in your account or otherwise share your information with the service provider.  Once you enable a specific third-party service provider to access your account, the service provider may continue to access your account until you affirmatively disable access.  Third-party service providers include both health care providers and other entities.  It is your sole responsibility to review and approve each such third-party service before sharing your information through or otherwise accessing it.

Google may screen, modify, refuse, or remove certain content or third-party services, but is not responsible for and does not endorse any third-party content or services.  Google further does not endorse any third-party service providers, other health care providers, products, services, opinions, or web sites accessed through Google Health.

USE OF THESE SERVICES AND RELIANCE ON THIS CONTENT IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.  GOOGLE MAY NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF ANY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE OR CONTENT.  Providers of these third-party services and/or content are Google's "Licensors".

8. Modification and Termination of Google Health

Google may place limits on, modify, suspend or terminate Google Health generally, and may suspend or terminate your use of Google Health if you fail to comply with this agreement. This suspension or termination may delete your information, files, and other previously available content.  If Google terminates Google Health or your use of Google Health, this agreement will also terminate, but Sections 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10-13 shall continue to be effective after this agreement is terminated.

9. Changes to this Agreement

<strong>Google may change this agreement</strong> and will post the modified agreement at https://www.google.com/health/html/terms.html. If you do not agree to the modified agreement, you should stop using Google Health. <strong>Your continued use of Google Health after the date the modified agreement is posted will constitute your acceptance of the modified agreement</strong>.

11. Exclusion of Warranties

NEITHER GOOGLE NOR ANY OF GOOGLE'S LICENSORS MAKE ANY EXPRESS WARRANTIES, AND EACH OF THEM DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ACCURACY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  NEITHER GOOGLE NOR ANY OF GOOGLE'S LICENSORS MAKE ANY WARRANTY THAT THE CONTENT IN GOOGLE HEALTH SATISFIES GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS REQUIRING DISCLOSURE IF INFORMATION ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRODUCTS.  CONTENT IN GOOGLE HEALTH IS DEVELOPED FOR USE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND NEITHER GOOGLE NOR ANY OF GOOGLE'S LICENSORS MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION CONCERNING THE CONTENT WHEN USED IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY.

12. Limitation of Liability

NEITHER YOU NOR GOOGLE OR ANY OF ITS LICENSORS MAY BE HELD LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY DAMAGES OTHER THAN DIRECT DAMAGES, EVEN IF THE PARTY KNOWS OR SHOULD KNOW THAT OTHER DAMAGES ARE POSSIBLE OR THAT DIRECT DAMAGES ARE NOT A SATISFACTORY REMEDY. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO YOU ONLY TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE LAWFUL IN YOUR JURISDICTION.

NEITHER YOU NOR GOOGLE OR ANY OF ITS LICENSORS MAY BE HELD LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR MORE THAN $1,000.

The limitations of liability in this Section do not apply to breaches of intellectual property provisions or indemnification obligations.

13. General Legal Terms

If you have not signed a separate written agreement with Google related to Google Health, this agreement is the entire agreement between you and Google related to Google Health, replacing any prior agreements. If there is any conflict between this agreement and a signed written agreement between you and Google related to Google Health, the signed written agreement will control.

Google's Licensors may be third party beneficiaries to this agreement.  There are no other third party beneficiaries to this agreement. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in this agreement creates an agency, partnership, or joint venture.

If Google provides you with a translation of the English language version of this agreement, the English language version of this agreement will control if there is any conflict.

Failure to enforce any provision will not constitute a waiver of that provision. If any provision is found unenforceable, it and any related provisions will be interpreted to best accomplish the unenforceable provision's essential purpose.</blockquote>

On Feb. 21, 2003 at TIME magazine's "The Future of Life" conference, Ray Kurzweil presented a talk based upon <a href="https://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0551.html?">this essay</a>. Subsequently, the <a href="https://lifeboat.com/ex/human.body.version.2.0">Lifeboat Foundation</a> reprinted a nicely photo "<a href="https://lifeboat.com/ex/human.body.version.2.0">enhanced</a>" version of the article. 

On today's five year anniversary, it may be a good time to take a glance at how we're doing. Breakthroughs like the concise articulation of the seven areas of SENS, the first carbon nanotube radio, patent applications for nano-assembler tools, a good start to data collection to accurately measure the rate of aging, and other breakthrough advances certainly bode well for many of the function requirements for Body 2.0.

Where are we making good time? Which areas do we need to redouble efforts? How can we continue to improve the scientific collaboration process as the challenges become more complex and interdependent? More than ever, Open Scientific Research and Coordinated appear vital to reaching our individual and collective goals.

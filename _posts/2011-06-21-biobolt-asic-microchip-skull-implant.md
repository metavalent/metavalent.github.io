Once again, the inexhaustible <a href="https://www.kurzweilai.net/new-brain-computer-interface-mobilizes-patients-opens-up-new-mind-control-scenarios">KAI reporting</a>:<blockquote>"A bolt implanted in the skull would contain an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) microchip under the skin in the skull. It would pick up and process neural signals, and transmit them via the skin directly to a receiver located in or near the target muscle group (such as an arm or hand)."</blockquote>[gallery link="file" columns="2"]

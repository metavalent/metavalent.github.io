Both Representative and Democratic AI, like "government of the people, by the people, for the people" is not only possible, it's happening.

We don't have to choose between any of the fad false dichotomies of the day. Nihilistic Stalinism vs. 
Optimistic Liberalism. Centralized Power vs. Disordered Chaos. Borg Collectivism vs. Individual Freedom. 

We have options. We always have options. Maybe we convince ourselves that we *didn't have any choice* or don't have any present or future options in order to justify acting upon sublimated, suppressed, subconscious beliefs and behaviors that we'd rather not face. One thing AI is sure to cause us to do is to face them, because AI is the ultimate extension of ourselves.

"The <a href="http://www.nsti.org/NanoInvestor2006/">Third Bi-Annual Nanotech for Investors Summit</a> brings together leading industry investors with top business and technology executives of nanotechnology growth companies. This intimate, executive-level event will provide an open and frank dialogue covering a financially-based outlook of how nanotechnology is, and will be, impacting global investments across various markets.

Jointly hosted by NanoDimension, a leading global venture capital firm in nanotechnology, and the Nano Science and Technology Institute, the largest industry and scientific organization focused exclusively on nanotechnology and organizer of the largest nanotechnology event in the United States."

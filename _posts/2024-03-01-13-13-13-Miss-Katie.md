> I don't do wishes. My prayers is already been answered by the Almighty. It's just people that I'm dealing with. My God does not put me through tests. He doesn't tempt not test me at all. He knows my my life from my mother's stomach, so I don't have to [worry]. It's people I'm dealing with. He left orders for people to take care of humans but they done disobeyed God, it's not -- they people should be taking care of other humans -- looking after their safety. Especially those in the law because they took on the name of the law, but to me they're lacking in the law. And like people have to look after themselves, you know, like look after [others]. How can I take a little nap and next thing I know -- all your stuff's gone -- and there's a whole bunch of drug dealers?

"There is a direct correlation between what the general public perceives about homelessness and how it affects policy change. Most people blame homelessness on the person experiencing it instead of the increasing shortage of affordable housing, lack of employment, childhood trauma, lack of a living wage, or the countless reasons that put a person at risk. This lack of understanding creates a dangerous cycle of misperception that leads to the inability to effectively address the root causes of homelessness." &mdash; [Invisible People](http://invisiblepeople.tv).

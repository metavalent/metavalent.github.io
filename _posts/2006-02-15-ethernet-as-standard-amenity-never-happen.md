From 1997-99 as we incrementally architected the concept and  topology of Ethernet To The Home (ETTH), we said that Ethernet should be considered a value-adding amenity, just like marble counters or a wood-burning fireplace.  This did not strike impatient dotcom investors as obvious at the time, so they lost opportunities for both leadership and huge, first-mover revenue advantages, and lost billions on their get-rich-quick dotcom schemes. In fairness, we were wrong, too, as below we now see that ethernet is not an "add-on amenity" but ETHERNET IS THE STANDARD AMENITY and the FIREPLACE IS OPTIONAL; quite the opposite of what most imagined in 1999.  This is one of those very worthy times in life where - WE TOLD YOU SO is just far too sweet to leave unuttered.  A sweet Valentine's bit of news, for sure.

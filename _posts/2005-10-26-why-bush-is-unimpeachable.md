According to <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/s/ucru/20051026/cm_ucru/whybushisunimpeachable;_ylt=AnY1qlwUHxrvXjzs_2gsuaMDW7oF;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl">Yahoo! News</a>: "Any safe can be cracked; every system of safeguards breaks down eventually. We can't get rid of Bush because the Founding Fathers, who were smart enough to think of just about everything, dropped the ball when they drafted the article that provides for presidential impeachment. Because there were no national political parties back in 1787, their otherwise ingenious system of checks and balances failed to account for the possibility that a Congress might choose to overlook a president's crimes.

Small parties were active on the state and local level during the late 18th century, but James Madison, George Washington and most of the other Founders despised these organizations as harbingers of petty 'factionalism' that ought to be banned or severely limited. Washington used the occasion of his 1796 farewell address to decry 'the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally. It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration,' he warned. 'It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another; foments occasionally riot and insurrection...In governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged.' Voting blocs were the enemy of good government."

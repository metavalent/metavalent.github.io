The shape of each tiny component dictates which piece it can attach to, a microfabrication technique known as <b>self-assembly</b>. Capillary forces -- the same type of forces that make water move up a plant's roots, and that cause the edge of a glass of water to curve upward -- pull the pieces into position. </blockquote><a href="https://uwnews.washington.edu/ni/article.asp?articleID=39094"></a>

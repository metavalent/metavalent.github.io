### I've lived with you all these years. I've watched you. I've listened to you, and I haven't gotten truth ...

... so I'm leaving you. There's a man a few miles further away, and I'm going to learn from him the truth.

Good luck with that. I'm confident that will work out exactly as well as it has every other time. How could it be any other way?

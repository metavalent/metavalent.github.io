<a href="https://mashable.com/2007/05/05/tutorom/" target="_blank">Tutorom</a>, taken to one histrionic logical extreme, might entirely obviate the idea of university as an institution for learning. The university archetype will likely continue to be effective as a utilitarian metaphor for productive civil interaction and exchange between diverse consciousnesses; each progressing along or across a spectrum of developmental and innate trajectories and capabilities. However, to the extent that self-directed and motivated information acquisition and synthesis plays a role in the individual development of sentient entities within that context, the Tutorom model presents an interesting method for encouraging and monetizing the free-flow of certain specific categories of information and knowledge. 

While I'm still working on the best algorithms for encoding, decoding, and presenting the results of this particular electro-chemical mushy matrix of gray matter, if the ideas in this blog continue to seem just beyond immediate comprehension, I apologize and promise to work harder to try and express some of the more ineffable intuitions in more plain language. Some might count it irresponsible to waste so much time purely goofing off with neural circuitry that could clearly be applied to more rigorous and structured pursuits; and they may be right. The only rationale that presently comes to mind is that some node has to to run these particular permutated derivative simulations, and as soon as Nick Bostrom or one of his posse provides me with an utterly unimpeachable, meticulously documented, reverse-engineered root-cause-analysis of the nature of Free Will -- then I will happily explain my own rationale in undertaking such seemingly juvenile, or even megalomaniacal narcissistic <a href="https://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=outrecuidance" target="_blank">outrecuidance</a>.

Defensive self-deprecating aggrandizement aside, what is the nature, purpose, and relevance of the concept of "society" in an uploaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik" target="_blank">Ubik</a>-quitous existence, anyway? Good fences have always made good neighbors in the meat-puppet world; but where we're heading, it's way beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Fields_Forever" target="_blank">strawberry fields forever</a>, my friends. Am I really even half as ready as I think I am? Are you?<blockquote>No one is on my wavelength,
I mean, it's either too high or too low;
That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right,
I mean it's not too bad.

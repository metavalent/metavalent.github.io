### Reflecting on Gregory Bateson's work,<sup>1</sup> what if Free Will is a kind of delicate and precious *Ecology of Mind* natural resource that requires, deserves, and even demands comprehensive ecological protection?

([10:33](https://youtu.be/KuqSHi-yXAI?t=10m33s)) "What we pay attention to *is* our life." &mdash; Amishi Jha.

Stanford Professor [Robert Sapolsky](https://profiles.stanford.edu/robert-sapolsky?tab=publications)'s latest book, [Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determined:_A_Science_of_Life_Without_Free_Will), has successfully re-ignited the conversation about the nature of free will with the wonderfully click-baity, "[I don't think we have a shred of free will](https://youtu.be/RI3JCq9-bbM?t=13)," based upon the argument that *all* human behavior is a response to sensory experience. Fun, right?

This one confuses me because it's from such a highly respected source. Maybe Sapolsky is tossing the grain of sand in the oyster to get a process started, or to see what happens.

My question is, why would free will not exist across a wide spectrum, significantly influenced by causes and conditions, with powerful circumstantial, environmental, and situational factors at play? Why would free will, an aspect of human cognition, not be self-similar to the spectrums of intelligence, agency, and personality traits? What an odd topic on which to flip so acutely binary with such a seemingly atypical, zealous misinterpretation of the data. Of course, it could be a touch of conscious histrionics for effect; somewhat of a sad necessity for monetization in the Distraction Economy. ü§∑

Meanwhile, social media keeps on doing [what social media does](https://youtu.be/KuqSHi-yXAI?t=821) to convince us that [we cannot possibly change ourselves](https://youtu.be/RI3JCq9-bbM?t=3m50s). Seems to me that, simply because Skinneristic interventions and meddling in people's lives in a way that effectively and *preemptively robs them of informed consent and agency, aka, their free well* is overwhelmingly effective, that does not provide compelling proof of the complete absence of free will. It simply means that some particular tribes of human-dabblers have successfully created experimental conditions that confirm that thesis. Cui bono?

Compare and contrast with [Daniel Dennet's take](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2024/03/07/08-08-08-Dennet-On-Free-Will.html).

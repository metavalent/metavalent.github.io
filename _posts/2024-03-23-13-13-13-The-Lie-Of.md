### Is literally, materially, empirically a lie because Local Realism is False.

But you're not trying to prove that you're *smarter* than Nobel Prize winners, only that you're infinitely more deceitful, deceptive, ensorcelling, malicious, and vengeful, isn't it? I mean, not *you* personally, right? Just the prosaic *objective* third-party "you," the brutally-matter-of-fact, but not mean, only-emotionally-devastatingly-condescending independent scrutineer "you," right? Not, "you," you, but in the people we know sense of "you."

If the only "reality" you comprehend is right in front of your very eyes, you are literally living a lie. The Nobel Prize was just awarded for [proving this](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-universe-is-not-locally-real-and-the-physics-nobel-prize-winners-proved-it/). Voting the truth off your little bubble-world island doesn't make truth untrue.

> The trouble with quantum mechanics was never that it made the wrong predictions ‚Äî in fact, the theory described the microscopic world splendidly right from the start when physicists devised it in the opening decades of the 20th century. But under quantum mechanics, \[entangled\] particles are not like \[paired\] socks, and only when measured do they settle on a spin of up or down. Under quantum mechanics, ***nature is not locally real***: particles may lack properties such as spin up or spin down prior to measurement, and they seem to talk to one another no matter the distance. \(On the macro scale, this is directly analogous to out-of-sight, out-of-mind as literally, empirically, *the definition of lying to ourselves*.\) &ndash; \([Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-universe-is-not-locally-real-and-the-physics-nobel-prize-winners-proved-it/)\)

Oh, but as they say, "it gets better."

That's not 35 out of 100. Notn 3.5 out of 100% of reality. Not even one 3.5<sup>th</sup> the size of 1% of whatever is 100% reality. 

### 0.0035% &asymp; 1/268<sup>th</sup> of 1%. That's the extent of your all-powerful "scientific concrete objective reality."

How's that workin' out for ya', when there's no one left to turn to? Just curious.

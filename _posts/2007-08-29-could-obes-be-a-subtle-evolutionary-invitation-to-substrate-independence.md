Of course, the subject question is my posthuman-biased recontextualization of these new findings, while The Economist reports more plainly that, "Out-of-body experiences (OBE's) can now be created at will. Studying them sheds light on the nature of consciousness." Not that the question is new, in the least. As this timely article reminds us, Anatomist Charles Sedgwick Minot opened the 1902 American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) meeting over a century ago with:<blockquote>I HOPE to convince you that the time has come to take up <a href="https://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9682520">consciousness as a strictly biological problem</a>.‚Äù</blockquote>For an aspiring futurist, <em>that</em> was an extrapolation worthy of complete envy and awe. The Economist goes on to report:<blockquote>In two papers published in <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/317/5841/1020a">this week's edition of Science</a> (subscription req'd), the AAAS's house journal, Ehrsson and Blanke report their latest results.</blockquote>

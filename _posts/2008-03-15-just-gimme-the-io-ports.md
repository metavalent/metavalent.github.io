If the inevitable <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13458-brain-map-project-set-to-revolutionise-neuroscience.html">human brain atlas</a> project can just give us <a href="https://humancortex.alleninstitute.org/">discrete access to the I/O ports</a>, we can pretty much hack the gray goo sufficient to achieve scaffolding independence, which is a significant step toward substrate indpendence. From there, maybe we can finally gain enough time to go the rest of the journey.

Seems to me that gaining access to all the brain's sensory I/O ports represents another viable means of essentially obviating senescence. After all, it's generally breakdowns of the scaffolding ... the human frame ... that do us in, while our brains stay relatively vibrant up to the point where scaffolding breakdowns begin impacting the brain itself.

The mouse brain map was completed in 2006. You can download the <a href="https://www.brain-map.org/">brain explorer software</a> and order the <a href="https://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470054085.html">Allen Reference Atlas</a> (ARA) from Wiley for what seems a pittance, considering the costs and value of the research.

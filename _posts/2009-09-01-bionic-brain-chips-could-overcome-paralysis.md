<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327232.300-bionic-brain-chips-could-overcome-paralysis.html?full=true">New Scientist</a>:<blockquote>It will be a long time before these chips can become a mainstream treatment: the US Food and Drug Administration requires as much as 10 years of animal testing before a chip can be deemed safe enough to be implanted in human brains. That means the latest technology, such as chips that stimulate tactile sensations in the brain, will need extensive testing before clinical trials can begin.

Yet even once the technology has proven itself, the social issues surrounding the treatment will need to be solved. Take the question of security, for example. Last year, a team of researchers successfully hacked into a heart pacemaker and defibrillator through the wireless communication that allows doctors to adjust its performance. Although the device wasn't implanted in anyone at the time, it raised the possibility that hackers could disrupt a patient's treatment.</blockquote>

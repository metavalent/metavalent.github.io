As of today, the <a href="https://metavalent.info/?page_id=499">subvalent domain name squatters</a> have been displaced; so we can drop the emphasis on ".dot. INFO" in page title, site ID branding, and finally move forward as <a href="https://metavalent.info/?page_id=2">initially intended in the secondary plan</a>. As always, it'll still take a couple days for DNS to propagate globally. Meanwhile, the Great Leap Forward is already well underway ... in SL, in FL, and mediated by scifi <a href="https://wikidashboard.parc.com/wiki/In_real_life">IRL</a>.<blockquote>Maia Skouris: "You're wrong mom. We are in control now. It's better that way."</blockquote>In other news, hooray for <a href="https://wikidashboard.parc.com/wiki/Ubik">UBIK</a> ... the fictitious (see note 1) OTC "ubiquinone" nutriceutical supplement is dubbed the make believe human enhancement risk-mitigating solution!<blockquote>Jordan Collier: "The world will have to deal with us."</blockquote><em>P.S. If these whimsical character quotations mean nothing to you, that's quite alright; but for those who are among The 300 IRL and The 4400 in SFL (SciFi Life), I just couldn't resist the post. :-)

P.S.S. HA-HA-HA! Whoever linked <a href="https://wikidashboard.parc.com/wiki/Ubiquinone">ubiquinone</a> in wikipedia to Coenzyme Q10 -- and thanks to WikiDashboard <a href="https://wikidashboard.parc.com/wiki/Ubiquinone">we get to see</a>! -- probably deserves to share in any awards that go to the 4400 team!</em>

(1) 12/1/2007 Update -- In another display of personal ignorance, I mistakenly called ubiquinone "fictitious." It's not. It is indeed a name for conventional CoQ10, while <a href="https://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2007/ss2007_report_coq10_01.htm">Life Extension Magazine reports</a>, "Findings just released at the 5th Annual International CoQ10 Symposium (November 9-12, 2007, in Kobe, Japan) show [enhanced absorption CoQ10] ubiquinol to be remarkably beneficial in those with advanced-stage cardiac disorders."

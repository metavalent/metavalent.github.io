<p>"<a href="http://www.dintz.com/eu-advises-on-posthuman-cyborg-future/" target="_blank">We should welcome with open arms the rich possibilities of technologically enhancing our bodies</a>," reports Andy Miah in the Guardian this week, adding the important caveat, "just so long as we don't all end up looking, and thinking, and acting the same."  </p><p>[Next month,] The European Parliament is set to debate issues surrounding smart drugs, cybernetic body enhancements, cosmetic surgery and more over the coming months to "establish an advisory committee on all aspects of human enhancement, the first committee of its kind."  </p><p>After all "we have always been beings in transition," argues Miah, who think the key is to find ways to "support responsible use" of body modifying technologies. </p>

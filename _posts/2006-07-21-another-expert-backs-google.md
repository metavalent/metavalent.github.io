Well, now.  There you go.  Now that Alex The Expert has deemed all things Fair and Balanced, that should put the whole issue to rest ... again ... right?  Until next time, anyway.  Apparently, it doesn't matter how 3vi1 the actual effect on customers, so long as <a href="http://metavalent.info/tchotchkes/3vil.is.as.3vil.does.html">anti-evil handwaving </a> is of reasonable visibility. "'Based on my evaluation, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/21/technology/google.reut/index.htm">I conclude</a> that Google's efforts to combat click fraud are reasonable,' Alexander Tuzhilin, a professor of information systems at New York University, said in the court filing."

title: The Structure Of Toxic Conversations on Twitter
tags: metavalent
---

Certainly, applies to all toxic online conversations, YouTube comments are equally infamous, let it alone the dumpster fires of 4-chan, 8-chan, and so forth. One tiny omission in this excellent data analysis, or maybe I missed it, but nowhere did I hear a definition of _toxicity_.

> Have you discovered or learned something interesting or valuable here? Something that piqued your imagination, creativity, research, discovery, or other academic, philosophical, or spiritual interest?

Every action we take in this multiverse, however small, matters and makes a difference. So, thank you and blessings, in this very moment!

This is so typical of left brain analytical thinking, just glossing over some arbitrary, subjective definition of _toxicity_ upon which the entire analysis is based. :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:

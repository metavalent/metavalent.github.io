WSJ.Com shocked the world today with <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115430897514621892.html?mod=djemTAR">this earth-shaking announcement</a> that means everything in the world of sport is now -- as never before -- exactly the same, only different.  What a phantasmagorical non-content noisemaker this stands to become.<blockquote>Two staples of television football -- Monday Night Football on ABC and the Sunday night game on ESPN -- are no more.</blockquote>Oooo .... are no more ... this is sooo hewwwge!<blockquote>Monday night's National Football League game will now appear on ESPN, and the Sunday night game moves to NBC. Both networks need to re-create their football identities and persuade legions of fans to change deeply ingrained TV-viewing habits.</blockquote>Yeah, man ... REALLY, REALLY, DEEPLY INGRAINED habits of clicking on channel 3 instead of 47.  What a tremendous, world-tilting SHIFT this will be; punching TWO NUMBERS on the remote instead of just one!  "Oh NFL and TV networks, you're SO BRAVE; I luuv yew!"

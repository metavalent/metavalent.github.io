Okay, so I took a little liberty by inserting the hypen and tweaking the capitalization in the subject, but that shouldn't diminish <a href="http://www.ugotrade.com/2007/11/19/global-communities-in-the-imagination-age/">this timely contribution from UgoTrade</a>, in the least:<blockquote>Rita pointed out that a key question facing people in the an age of mass media is how can you emerge and express yourself creatively and make a contribution?<blockquote>I think that the answer to that is becoming a conscientious global citizen in the most creative way possible, so that your art becomes your life [and vice versa]. In other words, you’re not creating music, books or paintings. You can, of course, and that’s a great way to spend time and express ideas, but if you approach your own life as a work of art, everything you do in that framework is something you’re creating, that others can watch and perhaps even learn from, and you can enjoy. The motion toward life as art is the hallmark of the artist of the conceptual age, the people age.</blockquote></blockquote>Wow. I can barely believe that someone actually GETS this, let alone articulates it so clearly. Perhaps there is indeed hope for humanity's transcendence.

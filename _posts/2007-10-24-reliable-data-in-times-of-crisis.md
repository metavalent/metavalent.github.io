Commentary: This is a very rare departure from the blog's theme, but seems justifiable, given the urgency of the situation. Yesterday I linked to a fire status mashup on another blog that now appears to be <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=114250687465160386813.00043d08ac31fe3357571">sponsored by KPBS</a>, complete with <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;output=nl&amp;msid=114250687465160386813.00043d08ac31fe3357571">KML file</a> for display in google earth. At the same time, the <a href="https://www.signonsandiego.com/firemap/">San Diego Union Tribune</a> had a similar mashup, but with conflicting data. Finally, the <a href="https://calfires.com/">Calfires.com</a> web site now has a mashup. I haven't taken the time to further analyze this latest site, but a friend and I both compared the first two sites yesterday, only to confirm that the sites had very different boundaries depicted for "voluntary" and "mandatory" evacuation zones.

All this data begs the question: how are people to determine authoritative and ACCURATE sources of data in such situations? Particularly when multiple "trusted brands" put out such information, it becomes literally a matter of life and death for the people in these areas. Even a quarter inch on a cute little map can affect thousands of human lives. It would be valuable indeed for sites like CAL FIRE [<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/">www.fire.ca.gov</a>] to be better advertised in cases like this. This is the one site where we can find fire status figures. As of October 24, 2007, 04:34 pm:<blockquote>

<strong>Santa Barbara County</strong>

In times of emergency, the role of the local broadcast franchise rapidly comes to the forefront and there is no compelling reason why virtually every television broadcast on the planet should not be accessible on the web. As an aside, it is a red herring to cite advertising concerns, because the bottom line is the the advertisers on any station will subsequently ALSO reach all the web viewers. Every TV channel on the planet should be on the web 24/7; it extends the reach of advertising and helps to make information markets more perfectly transparent and effective. That's what markets are <em>supposed</em> to be all about.

<div>"<a href="https://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0678.html">Push Singh</a> was a young MIT post doc making important contributions to AI with his Open Mind Common Sense project, a Web-based approach to acquire common sense knowledge from the general public. He was also one of KurzweilAI.net's big thinkers. He will be missed by us, and by many others."

Comments on the site case raises some complicated extropian ethical questions:
<blockquote> We've drafted a methodology for resurrection using superintelligent computers (when they arrive).

Man is a group of particles and is recontructable from future computer archeology, thought and all.

Any refutation of this is just not science.

Would it be ethical to "resurrect" [or reconstruct]  someone who had committed suicide?

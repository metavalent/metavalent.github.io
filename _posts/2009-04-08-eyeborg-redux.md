<p>This was <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/77406/Eyeborg">metafiltered</a> and reported by <a href="http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/12/eye-spy-filmmak.html">Wired</a> over four months ago. Today, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/04/08/bionic.body/index.html">CNN</a> is apparently defining an exciting and innovative new emerging trend for &quot;news regifting&quot; in mainstream media. As this human-computer symbiosis accelerates, external sources of information (TV's, iPhones, anything not <a href="http://metavalent.com/?p=969">jacked straight in</a>) will become increasingly irrelevant. Or possibly repurposed in the short to mid term for reaching and conditioning The Outsiders who are not yet tuned in to the Global Cognition Hivemind.</p>

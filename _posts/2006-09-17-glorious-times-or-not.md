<a href="https://online.barrons.com/article/SB115836203144964995.html?mod=9_0031_b_this_weeks_magazine_main">Barron's Online</a>:
<blockquote>"AMERICANS ARE LIVING LONGER, healthier lives than ever before and, if you believe everything you read, this is terrible news. With the cost of health care out of control, a Social Security system in crisis and an uncertain economic future, millions of worried, hard-working folks now fear they face an old age beset byâ€¦ hard work and worry."</blockquote>
Fairly typical of contemporary western socio-economic philosophy, the article dismisses the traumas of the many, as offset by the realizations of the few.

This approach is a nearly guaranteed way to ensure Unsustainable Posthumanism.

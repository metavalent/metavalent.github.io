<a href="https://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nnano.2011.119.html">Nature Nanotechnolgy</a> reports:<blockquote>the conductivity of the biofilm can be tuned by regulating gene expression, and also by varying the gate voltage in a transistor configuration. The conductivity of the nanofilaments has a temperature dependence similar to that of a disordered metal, and the conductivity could be increased by processing.</blockquote>

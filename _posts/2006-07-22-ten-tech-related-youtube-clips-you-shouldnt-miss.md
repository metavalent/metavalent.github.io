This entire <a href="http://news.com.com/2300-1026_3-6095928.html">CNET feature</a> is more than worthy of exploration, but you just CAN'T MISS what I hereby dub a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=SIn_J_jxf-o&amp;search=net%20neutrality">YouTube Investigative Series</a> on Net Neutrality. Obviously, to use Senator Stevens tech jargon, the U-Tube is one of the more popular of the various interwebnet Tubes that make up the large interTube net.

After that comedic take, why not try the more factual perspective of pioneering internet architect <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QMEf3FfuoI&amp;mode=related&amp;search=net%20neutrality">Vint Cerf's perspective</a>?

Finally, <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/06/rb_06_jun_23.html">Amanda Congdon</a> does a fairly good job of putting the issue of <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/06/rb_06_jun_23.html">Net Neutrality</a> in layman's terms, as well.

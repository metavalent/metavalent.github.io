I wonder how many people have read BOTH of these books? Regardless of on which side you find yourself, isn't it interesting that sites like Amazon encourage us to continue basking in our own side of the debate instead of suggesting books that might widen our world view?

Christianity is not any worse than other religions; similar critical questioning should be directed toward Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, or any faith's apologists and debunkers alike. Individuals on each side -- religiosity or reasonosity -- tend to hunker down and stockpile evidence for their own conclusions, once they've reached a basic conclusion. I'm not immune to this tendency, which I find peculiarly fascinating amidst human belief and behavior.

Why do we find these topics so compelling, aggravating, uplifting,  essential, and ultimately unavoidable?  We may never know.

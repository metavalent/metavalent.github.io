Brought to you by the same people who first helped us realize that all downloading is evil (oh, except the kind from their affiliate sites), Slasdot now reporting as the <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/07/1247235&amp;from=rss">RIAA Goes After Satellite Radio</a>. I guess if you think about it, not just satellite, but all radio is a constant streaming download, so it should all be banned, immediately. After all, you can "download" broadcast radio to any cassette recorder, dub the cassette to CD, create a .torrent for the file and there you have it: BROADCAST RADIO IS THE LEADING TECHNOLOGY OF MUSIC PIRATES! I agree with the RIAA and say shut down the entire broadcast radio industry before it's too late!

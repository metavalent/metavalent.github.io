What is it THIS time?  I mean, besides the utterly out of control, credit-card crazy, SpendAndSpend and SpendAndSpendAndSpendAndSpend Republicans.  Sure, tax may be the devil but Spend is the Beast that consumeth the world.

But it's neither Tax nor Spend in this case.  And it's neither cons nor dems; niether communism nor catholicism, mercantilism nor gnosticism, racism nor even that most subversive of all isms -- syllogism.  No, this time, it's much worse.  It could mean THE END OF THE WORLD.  In fact, these things were even foretold in the Koran, the Bible, Leaves of Grass, and particularly in Yeat's Mosada!  So take heed! The Day of His <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noodly_appendage">Noodly Appendage of Judgement and Doom</a> draweth nigh!

No, really!  For reals! It is truly, verily, in factly *that* bad.  So hurry.  Panic.  Run.  Duck and Cover.  Find the nearest fallout shelter.  The ENTIRE INTERNET is about to BLOW UP!!!  And here is the ever-so-shocking news, hot off the press, directly from the, "Now tell us something we didn't know two years ago" Department:

<a href="https://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/07/05/BUGL6JOQPA1.DTL">Click fraud a huge problem / Study finds practice widespread</a>

OMG!  What will we do without our precious AdWords!?  What's next, the <a href="https://metavalent.info/2006/07/aol-cant-even-give-it-away.html">END OF AOL</a>?  My GAWD!  What is the internet coming to?

And as Modern Corporate Custom requires:<blockquote>A spokesman for Mountain View's Google didn't respond to a telephone call seeking comment.</blockquote>Same <a href="https://metavalent.info/2006/06/evil-is-as-3vi1-does-googles-latest.html">as it ever was</a>.  Same as it ever was.  Same <a href="https://metavalent.info/tchotchkes/3vil.is.as.3vil.does.html">as it ever was</a>.

That's right. Because by definition, the deepest truth is both verbally inexpressible and existentially inescapable. Hence, until we can face this simple, tautological, galling inevitable verity, there is zero hope for living a life even approximating a sense of genuine integrity. It is what it is, and what it is is *way* beyond petty games of winning and losing. Resistance is never futile; however, it can be eternally self-defeating and self-destructive when that which is opposed is eternal.

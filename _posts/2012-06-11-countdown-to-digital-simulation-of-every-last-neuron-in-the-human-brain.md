Scientific American:<blockquote><a href='http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=human-brain-project-digital-simulation-neuron'>A Countdown to a Digital Simulation of Every Last Neuron in the Human Brain</a>. Building a vast digital simulation of the brain could transform neuroscience and medicine and reveal new ways of making more powerful computers. By the year 2020 digital brains may be able to represent the inner workings of a single brain cell or even the whole brain.</blockquote><p>Including, as long promised here, the emergence of neuroprosthetics, mind-machine interfaces, and hybrid human and machine minds. Now, things can begin to get interesting.</p>

The <a href="https://groups-beta.google.com/group/net.misc/msg/a76a83d6f2f51989">first usenet appearance</a> of the immortal Church of the Subgenius.  Definitely up there on the Top Ten Influencers of Original Net Culture list.  This is taken from Google's 2001 20th anniversary list of other notable <a href="https://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html">usenet firsts</a>.  Which begs the question, what will happen to Usenet in 2021 after Google's 20 year commitment expires?  Will usenet even live that long?  Is there any reason for it to be alive today?

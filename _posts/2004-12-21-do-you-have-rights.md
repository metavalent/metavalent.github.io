Yes, of course you do. Were you "created equal"? Of course you were. And who gave you those rights? Who created you equal? The Consititution? The Declaration of Independence? Let's take a look for a moment at <a href="https://www.archives.gov/national_archives_experience/charters/declaration_transcript.html">that Declaration</a>:

"... equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of <strong>Nature's God entitle them</strong>"

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed <strong>by their Creator</strong> with certain unalienable Rights ..."

"We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, <strong>appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world</strong> for the rectitude of our intentions,"

"And for the support of this Declaration, with a <strong>firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence</strong>, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor."

It is one thing to have a state that cannot declare an official religion, it is quite another to have a state that is forbidden from acknowledging the validity or even existence of religion as a human experience; the latter direction is the way that the popular media seems intent on heading, even while troops in Iraq are busy doing The <a href="https://tinyurl.com/5jayu">Lord's Will</a> so that those most prone to assert their rights continue to enjoy the right to rail against the very giver of their right to rail. Meanwhile, the railing camp generally enjoys casting the fickle finger of derision upon the hypocrisy of everyone but themselves. I don't condemn or damn them for this until they begin to trample on my right to explain where their rights came from - the founding documents of this nation. I do feel sorry for them, for there can be no deeper or more desperate dissonance in the human spirit than to be in the place they inhabit; hating God and wanting his recognition and approval more than anything else in creation. I know, I've been there, and I'm not making fun of anyone; nobody who has been there could ever make light of that hellish condition.

### Inflation isn't "a" single thing. Maybe that's why it puts the o from freak-out in freak-o-nomics.

Our bias: affirms a principle articulated in [the book](https://amzn.to/2URmAjL) by way of longitudinal analysis of US domestic investment priorities, with respect to the fundamental importance of universal #IncomeSecurity as stabilizing #SocialSecurity which underpins #NationalSecurity; namely, "inflation" isn't some Molochian monolith. Inflation is more like Medusaian mayhem, hence the collective trauma bonding of cheap stuff and expensive care.

In this chart: 

* Bedside manner, affection, warmth, sincerity, kindness, and presence, Above.
* Wanting, chasing, going and doing and getting and striving, distracting, distancing, dividing, Below.

What if we can all have nice things? Whate if there are plenty of nice things for everyone? We seem to be pretty good at churning out nice things. What if it's maybe the nice people pipeline that is maybe missing its quarterly numbers? What if that's maybe because the particular numbers being chased by a faultering default consensus reality aren't set by the nicest of people?

If the *hard cold reality* is that *you don't count* because *we don't live in a nice world* and *you can't just change the world* because you don't like *the way it works around here*, then what are the things that people of conscience *can do* to cultivate and create a default consensus reality that isn't like that deprecated, immutably mean, red in tooth and claw default? Whether you thing *nothing* or *everything*, you're right.

See how great it feels to *always be right?*

Maybe.

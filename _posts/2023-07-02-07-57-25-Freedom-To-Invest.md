### Gratifying Affirmation and Instantiation of Principle from our April post

Just discovered [S.523 - Freedom to Invest in a Sustainable Future Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/523/text?s=1&r=7&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22fiduciary+duty%22%5D%7D), which shows congress folk have long been onto [this concept](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2023/04/29/19-11-31-Fiduciary-Duty.html) of [upgrading Fiduciary Duty for the Post-Automation Era](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2023/04/29/19-11-31-Fiduciary-Duty.html).

This is more often the case than a divisive, defeatist, and fear-mongering MSM dare report &ndash; public policy work is ridiculously friggin *complex and nuanced* as [ChatGPT's snarky, condescending narcissism](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2023/06/30/08-08-08-ChatGPT-Sociopath.html) predictably and yet often accurately pontificates. Albeit, by way of some kind of apparently increasingly bizarre Bayesian bombast.

Add to this the general psychogenic epidemic of Dunning-Kruger Effect widely distributed throughout any general population, which goes something like this: "Those people doing the real work of governance *must* all be idiots, or *my* life would be better. If *I* were democratic despot and dictator, there'd be world peace."

If you or I were dictator, we'd still be a dictator. So, yeah, no.

If all that wasn't bombastically stupid and poorly written enough for you, just wait till you get a load of this idiotic idea: instead of having to fix every individual program, would it be ridiculous to [FIX THE CORE ISSUE once and for all](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2023/04/29/19-11-31-Fiduciary-Duty.html) with [Twenty-First Century American Economic Acceleration Act](https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2023/04/29/19-11-31-Fiduciary-Duty.html)? 

### ERISA Patch for Freedom in Fiduciary Duty

> Subsection (a) of section 404 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1104) is amended by adding at the end [the following new paragraph](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/523/text?s=1&r=7&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22fiduciary+duty%22%5D%7D):
> 
> “(3) (A) Provided that a fiduciary discharges the fiduciary's duties with respect to a plan in a manner otherwise consistent with this subsection, a fiduciary may—
> 
> “(i) consider environmental, social, governance, or similar factors, in connection with carrying out an investment decision, strategy, or objective, or other fiduciary act; and
> 
> “(ii) consider collateral environmental, social, governance, or similar factors as tie-breakers when competing investments can reasonably be expected to serve the plan’s economic interests equally well with respect to expected return and risk over the appropriate time horizon.
> 
> “(B) In a case described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A), a fiduciary shall not be required to maintain any greater documentation, substantiation, or other justification of the fiduciary’s actions relating to such fiduciary act than is otherwise required under this part.
> 
> “(C) Nothing in this part shall preclude an investment selected in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) from being treated as a default investment or a component of such a default investment (as described in regulations issued by the Secretary under subsection (c)(5)(A)), if such investment would otherwise qualify for such treatment under such regulations.”.

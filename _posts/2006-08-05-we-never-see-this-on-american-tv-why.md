Journalists who <a href="http://brasscheck.com/videos/middleeast/me5.html">ask questions</a>. Is that too much to ask for?  Wow.  Just wow.  Please watch the videos on this pages.  These are not wild-eyed lunatic anti-semites, these are current and former U.S. Government Officials asking Israeli Officials how it is that they can justify doing to the Palestinians what was done to them by Nazis.  

Many Israeli leaders even use the exact same rationale to defend their actions that the Nazi's used during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremburg_Trials">Nuremburg Trials</a> to defend Nazi brutality.  My fellow Americans, the long dreaded day of a Second American Revolution may be nearer at hand than we imagine.  Our very Constitution foresaw such a possibility if our representative democracy were to ever become hijacked by thugs.  Believe me, I don't even want to THINK about that, any more than you do; but if we do not, we will get the world we deserve.

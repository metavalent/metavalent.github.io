"Pelagia Irene-Gouma is a material scientist, professor and inventor at The Ohio State University."

> She holds 18 patents and is a member of the National Academy of Inventors and is the Founder and Director of the Center for Nanomaterials and Sensor Development.

> Professor Gouma will introduce her world-changing invention, a breathalyzer that can detect COVID-19. This disruptive nanotechnology for the early and rapid detection of the infectious pandemic disease relies on selectively identifying the gases that signal the disease in an exhaled breath and gives you results within 15 seconds. Dr. Gouma, a former graduate of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Greece, University of Liverpool, and The University of Birmingham, is currently the Edward Orton Jr., Chair in Ceramic Engineering at The Ohio State University. She has conducted research that involved the synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials for bio-/chemical sensors and biotechnology. She has established novel and highly successful programs on nanomedicine, with emphasis on the development of non-invasive breath and skin-based diagnostic tools. She's been featured as an expert in nanomaterials, ceramics, sensors, and photocatalysts in numerous press releases and has publications. She was a Fulbright Scholar, received the Richard M. Fulrath award of The American Ceramic Society and has been elected a Fellow of The American Ceramic Society. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Next, what to DO with all these capabilities, right? Granted, we're talking on the order of Atari Pong video game resolutions here; however, it didn't take long to go from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a> to <a href="https://www.thinkwithportals.com/">Portal 2</a>, right?<blockquote>iBrain promises to open a huge pipeline of data with its powerful but simple brain-reading tech, which is gaining traction thanks to technological advances. [Including] non-medicinal uses such as <strong>human-computer interfaces</strong> -- in an earlier announcement, NeuroVigil noted, "We plan to make these kinds of devices available to the transportation industry, biofeedback, and defense. Applications regarding pandemics and bioterrorism are being considered but cannot be shared in this format." And there's even a popular line of kid's toys that use an essentially similar technique, powered by NeuroSky sensors - themselves destined for future uses as games console controllers or even input devices for computers (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1751276/neurovigil-gets-incredibly-huge-cash-injection-to-read-your-mind">Fast Company</a>).</blockquote><div align="center">[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBqVUkn_4_M&w=480&h=390]</div>

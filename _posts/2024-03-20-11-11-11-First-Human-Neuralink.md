### Serendipity, coincidence, providence, or all of the above?

Free-will or not, TFW your first-cousin's son &ndash; whom you've never met or spoken to yet &ndash; posts this on the same day you finish your own lifetime-in-the-making book project describing the *reality* of the [Post-Automation Era](https://postautomationera.com/) that your own Default Consensus Culture mocked you about with "that'll never happen," for decades is ... wait for it ... literally inexpressible Bliss.

Can't wait till he's walking again ... On Earth as it is in Heaven. Godspeed, blissful first cousin once removed (one generation newer, improved edition)!

Also the exact same day: [David Brin](https://davidbrin.com/) shared this [sad and joyful news](https://www.facebook.com/AUTHORDAVIDBRIN/posts/804165974862720) of our inspired and inspirational senior statesman and good Ambassador of the Adjacent Possible, [Vernor Vinge](https://file770.com/vernor-vinge-1944-2024/):

> Accused by some of a **grievous sin ‚Äì that of ‚Äòoptimism‚Äô ‚Äì** Vernor gave us peerless legends that often depicted human success at overcoming problems‚Ä¶ those right in front of us‚Ä¶ while posing new ones! New dilemmas that may lie just ahead of our myopic gaze. He would often ask: **"What if we succeed?** Do you think that will be the end of it?"

A changing of the guard. A turning of the age. The dawning of the [Post-Automation Era](https://postautomationera.com/).

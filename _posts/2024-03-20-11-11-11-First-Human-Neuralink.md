### Serendipity, coincidence, providence, or all of the above?

Free-will or not, TFW your first-cousin's son &ndash; whom you've never met or spoken to yet &ndash; posts this on the same day you finish your own lifetime-in-the-making book project describing the *reality* of the [Post-Automation Era](https://postautomationera.com/) that your own Default Consensus Culture mocked you about with "that'll never happen," for decades is ... wait for it ... literally inexpressible Bliss.

Can't wait till he's walking again ... On Earth as it is in Heaven. Godspeed, blissful first cousin once removed (one generation newer edition)!

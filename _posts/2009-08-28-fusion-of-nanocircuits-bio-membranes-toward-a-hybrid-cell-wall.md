Bruce Lipton, <a href="https://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@0687472126.1251470909@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=cccladeiehdldgjcefecekjdffidfgi.0&amp;productID=SP_TRUE_000234">The Wisdom of your Cells</a> -- "the cell wall *is* a computing device" -- must be going ga-ga right about now, on <a href="https://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=/news/news_single.html?id%3D11034">this news</a>.<br /><a target='_blank' title='ImageShack - Image And Video Hosting' href='https://img35.imageshack.us/i/fusionofnano.jpg/'><img src='https://img35.imageshack.us/img35/1703/fusionofnano.jpg' border='0' /></a><blockquote>“This is much the same thing that happens in a cell,” Stroeve explained. “Now that we can open and close these channels, we can, in effect, regulate our system’s ability to sense chemicals in its environment.”</blockquote>Even if, as some critique, Lipton goes a bit too far implying the degree to which conscious thought can CONTROL that cellular interface, the basic mechanics of how cells work is fairly incontrovertible. This is not to imply that we "get it" to the extent necessary for inorganic tissue and organ genesis, en route <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=%22substrate+independence%22&amp;go=&amp;form=QBLH&amp;qs=n">substrate independence</a>; but it's certainly an incremental step in the right direction.

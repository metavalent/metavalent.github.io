From the site:<blockquote>"<a href="https://conceptnet.media.mit.edu/">ConceptNet</a> aims to give computers access to common-sense knowledge, the kind of information that ordinary people know but usually leave unstated.

The data in ConceptNet is being collected from ordinary people who contributed it over the Web. ConceptNet represents this data in the form of a semantic network, and makes it available to be used in natural language processing and intelligent user interfaces."</blockquote>

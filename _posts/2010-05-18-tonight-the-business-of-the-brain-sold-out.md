<blockquote>Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) promises a quantum leap in human interaction with technology -- enabling our thoughts and emotions to control devices and enabling devices to know what we’re "really thinking" and feeling. Currently, there are more than 300 million brain toting people in the United States alone, making the opportunities for BCI products far-reaching.

BCI is bringing fresh and often unexpected perspectives to established industries, from entertainment and transportation to medicine and information systems. In this emergent phase of consumer-related BCI, innovators are redefining sleep management, gaming, user interfacing, courtroom evidence, and national security—and this is only the beginning.

For the first time, neuroscientists and savvy entrepreneurs, from a number of traditionally unrelated industries, are teaming up to move BCI technology out of research and medical labs and into our everyday lives. The Business of the Brain event will address the challenges and opportunities of this exciting revolution, including limitations of “wet” sensors, “noise” interference, government regulation, novel user interfaces, designing industry-specific BCI applications and the cost engineering of current applications.

Meet the minds behind this wave and find out how entrepreneurs are using the way we think to drive the future of technology.
 
Topics to Be Explored:
<ul>
	<li>Developing new industries vs. enhancing current industries</li>
	<li>Hardware, software and service opportunities</li>
	<li>Barriers of entry (how to build them up or tear them down)</li>
	<li>What VC's are looking for in BCI</li>
	<li>Data interpretation and context</li>
	<li>Cutting edge vs. currently available</li>
</ul>

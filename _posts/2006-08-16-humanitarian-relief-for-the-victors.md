Alms for the poor victors!  Alms for the poor victors!  This is precisely the kind of arrogant hypocrisy that Israel's opponents find revolting.  Frankly, over the past several years I increasingly identify with anti-Israeli sentiment.  The more that I question what I was taught as a child in Sunday school, read the history, and simply OBSERVE Israel's behavior, the more I oppose both it's objectives and it's means.  

I understand that, under prevalent conspiracy doctrine, this makes me a Terrorist Sympathizer and therefore Suspect of The State.  I won't count on ever flying on a U.S. commercial airliner without coming under closer scrutiny.  I won't expect my credit score to reflect my true record of consistency.  I understand that, by stating publicly that I OPPOSE ISRAEL and that the 1948 partitioning was hogwash, "they" will put me on "the watchlist."  Oh well.  See that old fashioned quotation from the increasingly irrelevant Patrick Henry, above.

Today on C-SPAN, just days after bombing Lebanon back to the 19th century, displacing tens of thousands of Americans, and declaring a mighty military victory, Israel shows up with tin cup in hand, asking for help for THEIR "poor victims."  This is akin to Americans showing up in Saudi Arabia or Egypt today, asking for help for the "poor American victims" of the war in Iraq.  By definition, VICTOR and VICTIM are mutually exclusive.  You can't have it both ways, and to play it both ways is the definition of HUBRIS and HYPOCRISY.

Israel says it has a right to exist because of it's magic scrolls from God.  Islam says it is the one true religion because of it's magic Q'ran.  Christians say they are the only way because of their magic new testament.  Any moderately functioning, minimally objective, reasonable mind can't help but see the root of the problem, here.

Lyrics by XTC bear periodic repetition:

Dear God,

Hope you got the letter, and...
I pray you can make it better down here.
I don't mean a big reduction in the price of beer;
but all the people that you made in your image, see
them starving on their feet 'cause they don't get
enough to eat from God, I can't believe in you.

Dear God, 

Sorry to disturb you, but... I feel that I should be heard
loud and clear. We all need a big reduction in amount of tears;
and all the people that you made in your image, see them fighting
in the street 'cause they can't make opinions meet about God,
I can't believe in you.

Did you make disease, and the diamond blue? 
Did you make mankind after we made you? 
And the devil too?!

Dear God,

Don't know if you noticed, but... your name is on
a lot of quotes in this book, and us crazy humans wrote it, you
should take a look; and all the people that you made in your
image, still believing that junk is true. Well I know it ain't, and
so do you, Dear God ... 

I can't believe in ...
I don't believe in ...

I won't believe in heaven and hell; no saints, no sinners, no
devil as well; no pearly gates, no thorny crown; you're always
letting us humans down. The wars you bring, the babes you
drown; those lost at sea and never found, and it's the same the
whole world 'round; the hurt I see helps to compound that
Father, Son and Holy Ghost is just somebody's unholy hoax,
and if you're up there you'd perceive that my heart's here upon
my sleeve; if there's one thing I don't believe in ...

... it's you.

Dear God.

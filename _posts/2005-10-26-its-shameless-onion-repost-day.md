Given the news on Yahoo, that the <a href="http://in.tech.yahoo.com/051026/137/60qz4.html">White House asks spoof Web site to stop using seal</a> and the fact that the story seems oddly <a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/;_ylt=Am4gPsjlq_9k0Ewxo69W7itXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTE2ZjcyaWZvBGNvbG8DdwRsA1dTMQRwb3MDMgRzZWMDc3IEdnRpZANTTkdZMl8x/SIG=1273ii0jn/EXP=1130645754/**http%3A%2F%2Fnews.yahoo.com%2Fs%2Fnm%2Foukoe_uk_onion">broken on the primary U.S. Yahoo News server</a>, yet is consistently available via Yahoo! <a href="http://in.tech.yahoo.com/051026/137/60qz4.html">India</a>, as well as <a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/;_ylt=ArAmL9xbzmZqDqxL9zDfFCpXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTE2Y2E0M21iBGNvbG8DdwRsA1dTMQRwb3MDMwRzZWMDc3IEdnRpZANTTkdZMl8x/SIG=12ed6v81e/EXP=1130645754/**http%3A%2F%2Fau.news.yahoo.com%2F051026%2F15%2Fp%2Fwipr.html">Australia and New Zealand</a>, this time wasting exercise seems justified.

<ul><li></li><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/41444">Bush To Appoint Someone To Be In Charge Of Country</a>.  This is the allegedly offending story, but I don't see the seal anywhere except barely discernable on one of the flags in the background.  Surely that is not what they are referring to as misuse of the Great Seal!?
<li></li><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/38618">Mean Scientists Dash Hopes Of Life On Mars</a>. Somehow, this story just seems to complete a meme, here.  What the meme is, I'm almost afraid to articulate.</ul>

Why is it that the AOL-owned and operated <a href="https://www.icq.com/icqchat/index.php?cat_id=7">Beliefs &amp; Religion - ICQ Chat Rooms</a> include Atheism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, but not Christianity?  Is AOL just discriminating against religions that don't end with "m" or is it something a bit deeper?  Personally, I don't care too much for any of the world's famously fragmented violence and hate-breeding schizophrenic schism-isms, but if AOL is going to sponsor such an area it seems that it should be open to ALL or not open at all.

Larry Zdun, the group founder, said, "PeopleoftheUSA.com was formed to promote the deportation of illegal immigrants and terrorists from the United States. That is our purpose. We are here to stay and we won't stop fighting for the American citizens."

The group sees American jobs in jeopardy as illegal immigrants slip across the border and take jobs otherwise given to American citizens. They believe the welfare system is overtaxed and over-burdened and the easy entry on the U.S. and Canadian borders give ample impetus for terrorist attacks on America. They consider the astronomical cost of illegal immigrants to be unfair to American citizens who must pay through taxation, rising rates of health care, and support the overwhelmed welfare system.

People of the U.S.A Co-Founder Brent Zdun said, "We at the organization believe in what we are doing for the American citizens. We need to stand together as Americans and say 'no more!' We want to ensure that our voices are heard, and let freedom ring."

The Website quotes Theodore Roosevelt's words on Immigration in 1907: "...There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We have room for but one flag, The American flag...We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language...and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to American people."

In spite of the attacks on illegal immigration reform by the mainstream media that accuses proponents against illegal immigration to be racist bigots, People of the U.S.A wants to clarify that it is against Illegal immigration and is very much for legal immigrants who come here legitimately and MELD into American society and help SHAPE it.

The group is serious about their premise and passionate about their purpose. The activists for illegal immigration reform are going one giant step further by planning a class action lawsuit against the state of Florida for its lack of lawful immigration reform.

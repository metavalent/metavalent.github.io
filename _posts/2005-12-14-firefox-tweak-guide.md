<a href="http://www.techspot.com/tweaks/firefox/index.shtml"><img src="http://www.techspot.com/tweaks/firefox/box.jpg" border="0" /></a>The TechSpot.com site provides a very practical <a href="http://www.techspot.com/tweaks/firefox/index.shtml">Firefox Tweak Guide</a>.  Includes such useful tips as how to back up and restore Profiles.  From my own experimental install-everything-i-can-get-my-hand-on experience with Firefox, the most common "total meltdown" of Firefox is the result of a corrupted user profile.  If I had saved "last known good" profiles, I would not have had to manually rebuild my Firefoxen setups.  Although the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=447&amp;application=firefox">Infolister</a> extension certainly makes that task much more manageable, an extension that provides for single-click Last Known Good Profile would be fantastic.

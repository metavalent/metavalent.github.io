My shares from the Directed Share Program went from $17.00 to $6 to presently settle between $8 and $9 -- and I'm sticking with it.  If it's statesmanship you're looking for, try this on for size: I won't begrudge anyone getting in and riding back up to $20+ with me by this time next year.  Yep, you get to more than double your coinage and I'll only make $3/share.  Now that's statesmanship.

On the other hand, if you want a scumbag company worth kicking to the curb, lets pick one worth kicking.  For instance, as the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/29/technology/29aol.html">New York Times reports:</a><blockquote>Mr. Palfrey said ... software [does] not have to be malicious to violate consumer trust. “We currently recommend that users do not install the [free] version of AOL software that we tested,” the <a href="http://stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=aol082706">StopBadware.org</a> Web site read yesterday, “unless the user is comfortable with the level of risk we identify or until the application is updated consistent with the recommendations in <a href="http://stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=aol082706">this report</a>.”</blockquote>

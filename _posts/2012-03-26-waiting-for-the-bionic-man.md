The author's site lists this article as <a href="https://www.michaelchorost.com/mchorost-articles.htm" title="Waiting for the Bionic Man" target="_blank">Waiting for the Bionic Man</a>, so maybe Wired applied some kind of proprietary troll-baiting re-title algorithm to bump up the irritated enthusiast click through rate, or something: "<a href="https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/03/ff_prosthetics/all/1" target="_blank">A True Bionic Limb Remains Far Out of Reach</a>." Whatever. <a href="https://twitter.com/mikechorost" title="@MikeChorost" target="_blank">@MikeChorost</a>'s report is a fanstastic reality update to the previous post and indeed, all the content of this blog. We need much more of this to Get There!



From the article:
<blockquote><ol>
	<li>Hypothetically, a neurally controlled prosthesis would begin with a brain interface, a chip capable of picking up complex signals from the user’s brain.</li>
	<li>A computer would translate those signals into orders for the arm—”move up,” “bend my elbow,” “turn my wrist.”</li>
	<li>Motors in the joints would move the arm smoothly in response to commands from the computer.</li>
	<li>Sensors in the arm would feed information on its position and movement through the computer and into the chip in the user’s brain.</li>
</ol>

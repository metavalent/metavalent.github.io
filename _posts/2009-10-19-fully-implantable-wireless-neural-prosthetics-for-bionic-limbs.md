As presented Sunday 2009.10.18 at the <a href="https://www.sfn.org/am2009/index.aspx?pagename=blogging_tweeting">Society for Neuroscience conference</a> in Chicago and reported by <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/24263/">Technology Review</a>:<blockquote>Scientists at Brown University have developed an entirely implantable version of a neural prosthesis used to translate neural signals from the brain. The ultimate goal is to use this kind of device to allow severely paralyzed people to control a computer or a robot limb with their thoughts.

The array of electrodes that is implanted on the cortex is connected via a single wire to a data transfer chip, which is implanted onto the skull. The chip has a tiny laser, the size of a grain of sand, that transmits rapid pulses of light across the skin to a photodiode receiver placed on the scalp. The receiver converts the light signals back to electrical ones, and sends the information to a computer.</blockquote>

Yes. *Emojis are Narrative*. You can probably create a PhD out of it. As of this writing, there's [zero hits for "emojis as narrative](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=%22emojis+as+narrative%22&atb=v1-1&ia=web)," so, you're welcome. :laughing: If you do go for the PhD, at least maybe send [a cup of coffee and a bagel](https://patreon.com/metavalent), yeah? :coffee:

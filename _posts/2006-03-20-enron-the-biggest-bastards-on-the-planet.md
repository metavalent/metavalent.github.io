On October 23, 2001, <a href="https://www.arthurandersen.com/">Arthur Andersen</a> shredded all of its Enron records; more than ONE TON of paper!  Andersen, <a href="https://ml.com/">Merrill Lynch</a>, <a href="https://www.chase.com/">Chase</a>, <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/">Morgan Stanley</a>, <a href="https://www.citibank.com/">Citibank</a>, <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/">Credit Suisse</a>, <a href="https://www.vinson-elkins.com/">Vinson &amp; Elkins LLP</a>, and the rest can FIND the damned money! All of it.  $1.2 BILLION in retirement funds and $2 BILLION in pension funds.  It is nowhere near enough to merely send a few people to white-collar tennis-camp jail for life.  Even after you watch this, you'll find yourself wondering how it happened; it's simply beyond words.

So it goes something like this ... the men in society do their reproductive duty and immediately DIE. Yes, almost a perfect world right there, some may postulate! :-)  <br /><br />[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukS4UjCauUs&w=425&h=355]<br /><br />Next, the sated Divine Earth Micro Mother enjoys decades of unencumbered Life Creation, ruling her domain in meditative solitude, safe in the bosom of a colony that mostly does NOTHING. 

So, thou sluggard, if thou dost actually take up the Proverb's invitation to become like the average ant, your ambition must be to achieve Max Slack. Yes! All hail <a href="http://subgenius.com/">The Word of Bob</a>! Once and for all, these scientific findings finally prove that "the pattern is the message" and the FSM is just another upstart heretical fraud! Beware <a href="http://www.venganza.org/">his wily serpentine appendage</a>! Praise the One True Bob!

P.S. The title of this post uses "radical" as in Positive and Progressive, okay? No flamey-flamey, please. Rather, please read in the best possible context and try to realize that it's only meant to catch a little attention, not to imply anything about the personal politics of the brilliant and articulate Deborah Gordon, okay? Thank you.

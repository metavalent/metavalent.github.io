Only one word sums it up: WOW.  Literally every person I talked to understood what I was talking about and I understood them on a vast array of extropian topics far too numerous to mention.  Oh to live in such a world each and every day.  :)  Kurzweil, Hofstadter, More, and others were their usual illuminating selves, but it was the room full of PEERS that made the day one of the most exhilerating in recent memory.  After the summit, the singularity is nearer than ever.

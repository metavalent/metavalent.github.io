<blockquote>At some point we realized <a href="https://bilconference.com/">we are all interesting people with worthwhile things to say</a>, and it didn't make sense to rely always on centrally organized ways for spreading ideas. There is a time and place for traditional conferences, TED is a great conference, but perhaps a little emergence and anarchy is needed.</blockquote>If you'd like to <a href="https://bilconference.com/social-graph-experiment/">participate in the Social Graph experiment</a>, your friendly aspiring AI referrer is Metavalent Stigmergy, stigmergy -at- metavalent -dot- com ... hope to see you there!
